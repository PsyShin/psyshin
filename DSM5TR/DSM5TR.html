					<h3>Intellectual Developmental Disorder (Intellectual Disability)</h3>
					<p>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following three criteria must be met:</p>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.</li>
						<li>Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.</li>
						<li>Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.</li></ul>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> The term intellectual developmental disorder is used to clarify its relationship with the WHO ICD-11 classification system, which uses the term Disorders of Intellectual Development. The equivalent term intellectual disability is placed in parentheses for continued use. The medical and research literature use both terms, while intellectual disability is the term in common use by educational and other professions, advocacy groups, and the lay public. In the United States, Public Law 111-256 (Rosa’s Law) changed all references to "mental retardation" in federal laws to "intellectual disability."</p>
					<p>Specify current severity (see Table 1):
					<ul class="specifier">
						<li>F70 Mild</li>
						<li>F71 Moderate</li>
						<li>F72 Severe</li>
						<li>F73 Profound</li></ul></p>
					<table>
						<tr><td colspan="4" class="WhiteBlack">Severity levels for intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability)</td></tr>
						<tr><td width="10%">Severity level</td>
							<td width="30%">Conceptual domain</td>
							<td width="30%">Social domain</td>
							<td width="30%">Practical domain</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Mild</td>
							<td>For preschool children, there may be no obvious conceptual differences. For school-age children and adults, there are difficulties in learning academic skills involving reading, writing, arithmetic, time, or money, with support needed in one or more areas to meet age-related expectations. In adults, abstract thinking, executive function (i.e., planning, strategizing, priority setting, and cognitive flexibility), and short-term memory, as well as functional use of academic skills (e.g., reading, money management), are impaired. There is a somewhat concrete approach to problems and solutions compared with age-mates.</td>
							<td>Compared with typically developing age-mates, the individual is immature in social interactions. For example, there may be difficulty in accurately perceiving peers’ social cues. Communication, conversation, and language are more concrete or immature than expected for age. There may be difficulties regulating emotion and behavior in age-appropriate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by peers in social situations. There is limited understanding of risk in social situations; social judgment is immature for age, and the person is at risk of being manipulated by others (gullibility).</td>
							<td>The individual may function age-appropriately in personal care. Individuals need some support with complex daily living tasks in comparison to peers. In adulthood, supports typically involve grocery shopping, transportation, home and child-care organizing, nutritious food preparation, and banking and money management. Recreational skills resemble those of age-mates, although judgment related to well-being and organization around recreation requires support. In adulthood, competitive employment is often seen in jobs that do not emphasize conceptual skills. Individuals generally need support to make health care decisions and legal decisions, and to learn to perform a skilled vocation competently. Support is typically needed to raise a family.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Moderate</td>
							<td>All through development, the individual’s conceptual skills lag markedly behind those of peers. For preschoolers, language and preacademic skills develop slowly. For school-age children, progress in reading, writing, mathematics, and understanding of time and money occurs slowly across the school years and is markedly limited compared with that of peers. For adults, academic skill development is typically at an elementary level, and support is required for all use of academic skills in work and personal life. Ongoing assistance on a daily basis is needed to complete conceptual tasks of day-to-day life, and others may take over these responsibilities fully for the individual.</td>
							<td>The individual shows marked differences from peers in social and communicative behavior across development. Spoken language is typically a primary tool for social communication but is much less complex than that of peers. Capacity for relationships is evident in ties to family and friends, and the individual may have successful friendships across life and sometimes romantic relations in adulthood. However, individuals may not perceive or interpret social cues accurately. Social judgment and decision- making abilities are limited, and caretakers must assist the person with life decisions. Friendships with typically developing peers are often affected by communication or social limitations. Significant social and communicative support is needed in work settings for success.</td>
							<td>The individual can care for personal needs involving eating, dressing, elimination, and hygiene as an adult, although an extended period of teaching and time is needed for the individual to become independent in these areas, and reminders may be needed. Similarly, participation in all household tasks can be achieved by adulthood, although an extended period of teaching is needed, and ongoing supports will typically occur for adult-level performance. Independent employment in jobs that require limited conceptual and communication skills can be achieved, but considerable support from coworkers, supervisors, and others is needed to manage social expectations, job complexities, and ancillary responsibilities such as scheduling, transportation, health benefits, and money management. A variety of recreational skills can be developed. These typically require additional supports and learning opportunities over an extended period of time. Maladaptive behavior is present in a significant minority and causes social problems.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Severe</td>
							<td>Attainment of conceptual skills is limited. The individual generally has little understanding of written language or of concepts involving numbers, quantity, time, and money. Caretakers provide extensive supports for problem solving throughout life.</td>
							<td>Spoken language is quite limited in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Speech may be single words or phrases and may be supplemented through augmentative means. Speech and communication are focused on the here and now within everyday events. Language is used for social communication more than for explication. Individuals understand simple speech and gestural communication. Relationships with family members and familiar others are a source of pleasure and help.</td>
							<td>The individual requires support for all activities of daily living, including meals, dressing, bathing, and elimination. The individual requires supervision at all times. The individual cannot make responsible decisions regarding well-being of self or others. In adulthood, participation in tasks at home, recreation, and work requires ongoing support and assistance. Skill acquisition in all domains involves long-term teaching and ongoing support. Maladaptive behavior, including self-injury, is present in a significant minority.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Profound</td>
							<td>Conceptual skills generally involve the physical world rather than symbolic processes. The individual may use objects in goal-directed fashion for self-care, work, and recreation. Certain visuospatial skills, such as matching and sorting based on physical characteristics, may be acquired. However, co-occurring motor and sensory impairments may prevent functional use of objects.</td>
							<td>The individual has very limited understanding of symbolic communication in speech or gesture. He or she may understand some simple instructions or gestures. The individual expresses his or her own desires and emotions largely through nonverbal, nonsymbolic communication. The individual enjoys relationships with well- known family members, caretakers, and familiar others, and initiates and responds to social interactions through gestural and emotional cues. Co-occurring sensory and physical impairments may prevent many social activities.</td>
							<td>The individual is dependent on others for all aspects of daily physical care, health, and safety, although he or she may be able to participate in some of these activities as well. Individuals without severe physical impairments may assist with some daily work tasks at home, like carrying dishes to the table. Simple actions with objects may be the basis of participation in some vocational activities with high levels of ongoing support. Recreational activities may involve, for example, enjoyment in listening to music, watching movies, going out for walks, or participating in water activities, all with the support of others. Co-occurring physical and sensory impairments are frequent barriers to participation (beyond watching) in home, recreational, and vocational activities. Maladaptive behavior is present in a significant minority.</td></tr>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>The diagnosis of intellectual developmental disorder should be made whenever Criteria A, B, and C are met. A diagnosis of intellectual developmental disorder should not be assumed because of a particular genetic or medical condition. A genetic syndrome linked to intellectual developmental disorder should be noted as a concurrent diagnosis with the intellectual developmental disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Major and mild neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
					<br>Intellectual developmental disorder is categorized as a neurodevelopmental disorder and is distinct from the neurocognitive disorders, which are characterized by a loss of cognitive functioning. Major neurocognitive disorder may co-occur with intellectual developmental disorder (e.g., an individual with Down syndrome who develops Alzheimer’s disease, or an individual with intellectual developmental disorder who loses further cognitive capacity following a head injury). In such cases, the diagnoses of intellectual developmental disorder and neurocognitive disorder may both be given. Moreover, when there is stabilization of cognitive functioning following traumatic or nontraumatic brain injury with onset in the developmental period (childhood and adolescence), and there is no continuing cognitive decline, both neurocognitive disorder and intellectual developmental disorder diagnoses can be used if diagnostic criteria are met for intellectual developmental disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Communication disorders and specific learning disorder.</strong><br>These neurodevelopmental disorders are specific to the communication and learning domains and do not show deficits in intellectual and adaptive behavior. They may co-occur with intellectual developmental disorder. Both diagnoses are made if full criteria are met for intellectual developmental disorder and a communication disorder or specific learning disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong><br>Intellectual developmental disorder is common among individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Assessment of intellectual ability may be complicated by social- communication and behavior deficits inherent to autism spectrum disorder, which may interfere with understanding and complying with test procedures. Appropriate assessment of intellectual functioning in autism spectrum disorder is essential, with reassessment across the developmental period, because IQ scores in autism spectrum disorder may be unstable, particularly in early childhood.</p>

				<div id="Ch1_2" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Global Developmental Delay<br>F88</h3>
					<p>This diagnosis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years when the clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood. This category is diagnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including children who are too young to participate in standardized testing. This category requires reassessment after a period of time.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="Ch1_3" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder (Intellectual Disability)<br>F79</h3>
					<p>This category is reserved for individuals over the age of 5 years when assessment of the degree of intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) by means of locally available procedures is rendered difficult or impossible because of associated sensory or physical impairments, as in blindness or prelingual deafness; locomotor disability; or presence of severe problem behaviors or co-occurring mental disorder. This category should only be used in exceptional circumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time.</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normal variations in language.</strong>
						<br>Language disorder needs to be distinguished from normal developmental variations, and this distinction may be difficult to make before age 4 years. Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of language (e.g., dialects) must be considered when an individual is being assessed for language impairment.</p>
					<p><strong>Hearing or other sensory impairment.</strong>
						<br>Hearing impairment needs to be excluded as the primary cause of language difficulties. Language deficits may be associated with a hearing impairment, other sensory deficit, or a speech-motor deficit. When language deficits are in excess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of language disorder may be made.</p>
					<p><strong>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).</strong>
						<br>Language impairment is often the presenting feature of intellectual developmental disorder. However, the definitive diagnosis of intellectual developmental disorder may not be made until the child is able to complete standardized assessments. Language disorder can occur with varying degrees of intellectual ability, and a discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal ability is not necessary for a diagnosis of language disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Autism spectrum disorder frequently manifests with delayed language development. However, autism spectrum disorder is often accompanied by behaviors not present in language disorder, such as lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g., pulling individuals by the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns (e.g., carrying toys around but never playing with them), unusual communication patterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name), and rigid adherence to routines and repetitive behaviors (e.g., flapping, spinning, echolalia).</p>
					<p><strong>Neurological disorders.</strong>
						<br>Language disorder can be acquired in association with neurological disorders, including epilepsy (e.g., acquired aphasia or Landau-Kleffner syndrome).</p>
					<p><strong>Language regression.</strong>
						<br>Loss of speech and language in a child at any age warrants thorough assessment to determine if there is a specific neurological condition, such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Language loss may be a symptom of seizures, and a diagnostic assessment is necessary to exclude the presence of epilepsy (e.g., routine and sleep electroencephalogram). Declines in critical social and communication behaviors during the first 2 years of life are evident in most children presenting with autism spectrum disorder and should signal the need for autism spectrum disorder assessment.</p>

					<h3>Speech Sound Disorder<br>F80.0</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intelligibility or prevents verbal communication of messages.</li>
						<li>The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.</li>
						<li>Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.</li>
						<li>The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medical or neurological conditions.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normal variations in speech.</strong>
						<br>Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of speech should be considered before making the diagnosis. Bilingual children may demonstrate an overall lower intelligibility rating, make more overall consonant and vowel errors, and produce more uncommon error patterns than monolingual English-speaking children when assessed only in English.</p>
					<p><strong>Hearing or other sensory impairment.</strong>
						<br>Those who are deaf or hard of hearing may have speech sound production errors. When speech deficits are in excess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of speech sound disorder may be made.</p>
					<p><strong>Structural deficits.</strong>
						<br>Speech impairment may be due to structural deficits (e.g., cleft palate).</p>
					<p><strong>Dysarthria.</strong>
						<br>Speech impairment may be attributable to a motor disorder, such as cerebral palsy. Neurological signs, as well as distinctive features of voice, differentiate dysarthria from speech sound disorder, although in young children (under 3 years) differentiation may be difficult, particularly when there is no or minimal general body motor involvement (as in, e.g., Worster- Drought syndrome).</p>
					<p><strong>Selective mutism.</strong>
						<br>Limited use of speech may be a sign of selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that is characterized by a lack of speech in one or more contexts or settings. Selective mutism may develop in children with a speech disorder because of embarrassment about their impairments, but many children with selective mutism exhibit normal speech in "safe" settings, such as at home or with close friends.</p>

					<h3>Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)<br>F80.81</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li> Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that are inappropriate for the individual’s age and language skills, persist over time, and are characterized by frequent and marked occurrences of one (or more) of the following:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Sound and syllable repetitions.</li>
							<li>Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.</li>
							<li>Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word).</li>
							<li>Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech).</li>
							<li>Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words).</li>
							<li>Words produced with an excess of physical tension.</li>
							<li>Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., "I-I-I-I see him").</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in effective communication, social participation, or academic or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.</li>
						<li>The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. (Note: Later-onset cases are diagnosed as F98.5 adult-onset fluency disorder.)</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit, dysfluency associated with neurological insult (e.g., stroke, tumor, trauma), or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Sensory deficits.</strong>
						<br>Dysfluencies of speech may be associated with a hearing impairment or other sensory deficit or a speech-motor deficit. When the speech dysfluencies are in excess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of childhood-onset fluency disorder may be made.</p>
					<p><strong>Normal speech dysfluencies.</strong>
						<br>The disorder must be distinguished from normal dysfluencies that occur frequently in young children, which include whole-word or phrase repetitions (e.g., "I want, I want ice cream"), incomplete phrases, interjections, unfilled pauses, and parenthetical remarks. If these difficulties increase in frequency or complexity as the child grows older, a diagnosis of childhood-onset fluency disorder may be appropriate.</p>
					<p><strong>Specific learning disorder, with impairment in reading.</strong>
						<br>Children who have dysfluencies when they read aloud may be diagnosed mistakenly as having a reading disorder. Oral reading fluency typically is measured by timed assessments. Slower reading rates may not accurately reflect the actual reading ability of children who stutter.</p>
					<p><strong>Bilingualism.</strong>
						<br>It is necessary to distinguish between dysfluencies resulting from attempts to learn a new language and dysfluencies that indicate a fluency disorder, which typically appear in both languages.</p>
					<p><strong>Medication side effects.</strong>
						<br>Stuttering may occur as a side effect of medication and may be detected by a temporal relationship with exposure to the medication.</p>
					<p><strong>Adult-onset dysfluencies.</strong>
						<br>If onset of dysfluencies is during or after adolescence, it is an "adult- onset dysfluency" rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder. Adult-onset dysfluencies are associated with specific neurological insults and a variety of medical conditions and mental disorders and may be specified with them, but they are not a DSM-5 diagnosis.</p>
					<p><strong>Tourette’s disorder.</strong>
						<br>Vocal tics and repetitive vocalizations of Tourette’s disorder should be distinguishable from the repetitive sounds of childhood-onset fluency disorder by their nature and timing.</p>

						<ul class="number">
							<li>Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and sharing information, in a manner that is appropriate for the social context.</li>
							<li>Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context or the needs of the listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a playground, talking differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal language.</li>
							<li>Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal signals to regulate interaction.</li>
							<li>Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in combination.</li>
						<li>The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental period (but deficits may not become fully manifest until social communication demands exceed limited capacities).</li>

					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Autism spectrum disorder is the primary diagnostic consideration for individuals presenting with social communication deficits. The two disorders can be differentiated by the presence in autism spectrum disorder of restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities and their absence in social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may only display the restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities during the early developmental period, so a comprehensive history should be obtained. Current absence of symptoms would not preclude a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, if the restricted interests and repetitive behaviors were present in the past. A diagnosis of social (pragmatic) communication disorder should be considered only if the current symptoms or developmental history fails to reveal evidence of symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria for restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities of autism spectrum disorder (i.e., Criterion B) causing current impairment. The social communication symptoms may be milder in social (pragmatic) communication disorder than in autism spectrum disorder, although qualitatively similar.</p>
					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Primary deficits of ADHD may cause impairments in social communication and functional limitations of effective communication, social participation, or academic achievement.</p>
					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>The symptoms of social (pragmatic) communication disorder overlap with those of social anxiety disorder. The differentiating feature is the timing of the onset of symptoms. In social (pragmatic) communication disorder, the individual has never had effective social communication; in social anxiety disorder, the social communication skills developed appropriately but are not utilized because of anxiety, fear, or distress about social interactions.</p>
					<p><strong>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) and global developmental delay.</strong>
						<br>Social communication skills may be deficient among individuals with global developmental delay or intellectual developmental disorder, but a separate diagnosis is not given unless the social communication deficits are clearly in excess of the intellectual limitations.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder.</strong>
						<br>Abnormalities of attention (overly focused or easily distracted) are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, as is hyperactivity. Moreover, some individuals with ADHD may exhibit social communication deficits such as interrupting others, speaking too loudly, and not respecting personal space. Although potentially difficult to discriminate ADHD from autism spectrum disorder, the developmental course and absence of restricted, repetitive behaviors and unusual interests in ADHD help in differentiating the two conditions. A concurrent diagnosis of ADHD should be considered when attentional difficulties or hyperactivity exceeds that typically seen in individuals of comparable mental age, and ADHD is one of the most common comorbidities in autism spectrum disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) without autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Intellectual developmental disorder without autism spectrum disorder may be difficult to differentiate from autism spectrum disorder in very young children. Individuals with intellectual developmental disorder who have not developed language or symbolic skills also present a challenge for differential diagnosis, since repetitive behavior often occurs in such individuals as well. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in an individual with intellectual developmental disorder is appropriate when social communication and interaction are significantly impaired relative to the developmental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills (e.g., fine motor skills, nonverbal problem solving). In contrast, intellectual developmental disorder is the appropriate diagnosis when there is no apparent discrepancy between the level of social communicative skills and other intellectual skills.</p>
					<p><strong>Language disorders and social (pragmatic) communication disorder.</strong>
						<br>In some forms of language disorder, there may be problems of communication and some secondary social difficulties. However, specific language disorder is not usually associated with abnormal nonverbal communication, nor with the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.
						<br>When an individual shows impairment in social communication and social interactions but does not show restricted and repetitive behavior or interests, criteria for social (pragmatic) communication disorder, instead of autism spectrum disorder, may be met. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder supersedes that of social (pragmatic) communication disorder whenever the criteria for autism spectrum disorder are met, and care should be taken to enquire carefully regarding past or current restricted/repetitive behavior.</p>
					<p><strong>Selective mutism.</strong>
						<br>In selective mutism, early development is not typically disturbed. The affected child usually exhibits appropriate communication skills in certain contexts and settings. Even in settings where the child is mute, social reciprocity is not impaired, nor are restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior present.</p>
					<p><strong>Stereotypic movement disorder.</strong>
						<br>Motor stereotypies are among the diagnostic characteristics of autism spectrum disorder, so an additional diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not given when such repetitive behaviors are better explained by the presence of autism spectrum disorder. However, when stereotypies cause self-injury and become a focus of treatment, both diagnoses may be appropriate.</p>
					<p><strong>Rett syndrome.</strong>
						<br>Disruption of social interaction may be observed during the regressive phase of Rett syndrome (typically between ages 1 and 4 years); thus, a substantial proportion of affected young girls may have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder. However, after this period, most individuals with Rett syndrome improve their social communication skills, and autistic features are no longer a major area of concern. Consequently, autism spectrum disorder should be considered only when all diagnostic criteria are met.</p>
					<p><strong>Symptoms associated with anxiety disorders.</strong>
						<br>The overlap of anxiety symptoms with the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder can make the classification of anxiety symptoms in autism spectrum disorder challenging. For example, social withdrawal and repetitive behaviors are core features of autism spectrum disorder but may also be expressions of anxiety. The most common anxiety disorders in autism spectrum disorder are specific phobia (in up to 30% of cases), and social anxiety and agoraphobia (in as many as 17% of cases).</p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Repetitive behavior is a defining feature of both obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorder. In both conditions, repetitive behaviors are considered to be inappropriate or odd. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, intrusive thoughts are often related to contamination, organization, or sexual or religious themes. Compulsions are performed in response to these intrusive thoughts in attempts to relieve anxiety. In autism spectrum disorder, repetitive behaviors classically include more stereotyped motor behaviors, such as hand flapping and finger shaking or more complex behaviors, such as insistence on routines or lining up objects. Contrary to obsessive-compulsive disorder, repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorder may be perceived as pleasurable and reinforcing.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizophrenia.</strong>
						<br>Schizophrenia with childhood onset usually develops after a period of normal, or near normal, development. A prodromal state has been described in which social impairment and atypical interests and beliefs occur, which could be confused with the social deficits and restricted fixated interests seen in autism spectrum disorder. Hallucinations and delusions, which are defining features of schizophrenia, are not features of autism spectrum disorder. However, clinicians must take into account the potential for individuals with autism spectrum disorder to be concrete in their interpretation of questions regarding the key features of schizophrenia (e.g., "Do you hear voices when no one is there?" "Yes [on the radio]"). Autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia can co-occur, and both should be diagnosed when criteria are met.</p>
					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>In adults without intellectual developmental disorder or significant language impairment, some behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder may be perceived by others as symptoms of narcissistic, schizotypal, or schizoid personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder in particular may intersect with autism spectrum disorder in unusual preoccupations and perceptual experiences, odd thinking and speech, constricted affect and social anxiety, lack of close friends, and odd or eccentric behavior. The early developmental course of autism spectrum disorder (lack of imaginative play, restricted/repetitive behavior, sensory sensitivities) is most helpful in differentiating it from personality disorders.</p>

Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some individuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes toward such tasks and devalue their importance.</p>

						<br>ADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high levels of impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent explosive disorder show serious aggression toward others, which is not characteristic of ADHD, and they do not experience problems with sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder may be diagnosed in the presence of ADHD.</p>
					<p><strong>Other neurodevelopmental disorders.</strong>
						<br>The increased motoric activity that may occur in ADHD must be distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that characterizes stereotypic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum disorder. In stereotypic movement disorder, the motoric behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rocking, self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are typically generalized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic movements. In Tourette’s disorder, frequent multiple tics can be mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness of ADHD. Prolonged observation may be needed to differentiate fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics.</p>
					<p><strong>Specific learning disorder.</strong>
						<br>Children with specific learning disorder alone may appear inattentive because of frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability in neurocognitive processes, including working memory and processing speed, whereas their inattention is much reduced when performing a skill that does not require the impaired cognitive process.</p>
					<p><strong>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).</strong>
						<br>Symptoms of ADHD are common in children with intellectual developmental disorder placed in academic settings that are inappropriate to their intellectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms are not evident during nonacademic tasks. A diagnosis of ADHD in intellectual developmental disorder requires that inattention or hyperactivity be excessive for mental age.</p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with ADHD and those with autism spectrum disorder exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and difficult-to-manage behavior. The social dysfunction and peer rejection seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished from the social disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and tonal communication cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism spectrum disorder may display tantrums because of an inability to tolerate a change from their expected course of events. In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a tantrum during a major transition because of impulsivity or poor self-control.</p>
					<p><strong>Reactive attachment disorder.</strong>
						<br>Children with reactive attachment disorder may show social disinhibition, but not the full ADHD symptom cluster, and display other features such as a lack of enduring relationships that are not characteristic of ADHD.</p>
					<p><strong>Anxiety disorders.</strong>
						<br>ADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Individuals with ADHD are inattentive because of their preferential engagement with novel and stimulating activities or preoccupation with enjoyable activities. This is distinguished from the inattention attributable to worry and rumination seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen in anxiety disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry and rumination.</p>
					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder</strong>
						<br>Concentration difficulties associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be misdiagnosed in children as ADHD. Children younger than 6 years often manifest PTSD in nonspecific symptoms such as restlessness, irritability, inattention, and poor concentration, which can mimic ADHD. Parents may also minimize their children’s trauma-related symptoms, and teachers and other caregivers are often unaware of the child’s exposure to traumatic events. A comprehensive assessment of past exposure to traumatic events can rule out PTSD.</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with depressive disorders may present with inability to concentrate. However, poor concentration in mood disorders becomes prominent only during a depressive episode.</p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with bipolar disorder may have increased activity, poor concentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features are episodic, unlike ADHD, in which the symptoms are persistent. Moreover, in bipolar disorder, increased impulsivity or inattention is accompanied by elevated mood, grandiosity, and other specific bipolar features. Children with ADHD may show significant changes in mood within the same day; such lability is distinct from a manic or hypomanic episode, which must last 4 or more days to be a clinical indicator of bipolar disorder, even in children. Bipolar disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when severe irritability and anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common among children and adolescents who display excessive anger and irritability.</p>
					<p><strong>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.</strong>
						<br>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by pervasive irritability, and intolerance of frustration, but impulsiveness and disorganized attention are not essential features. However, most children and adolescents with the disorder also have symptoms that meet criteria for ADHD, which is diagnosed separately.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Differentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be problematic if the first presentation of ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or frequent use. Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse from informants or previous records may be essential for differential diagnosis.</p>
					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>In adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD from borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. Some personality disorders tend to share the features of disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and cognitive dysregulation. However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment, self-injury, extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder. It may take extended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed history to distinguish impulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate behavior from narcissistic, aggressive, or domineering behavior to make this differential diagnosis.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>ADHD is not diagnosed if the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Medication-induced symptoms of ADHD.</strong>
						<br>Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity attributable to the use of medication (e.g., bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuroleptics [resulting in akathisia], thyroid replacement medication) are diagnosed as other specified or unspecified other (or unknown) substance–related disorders.</p>
					<p><strong>Neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>While impairment in complex attention may be one of the affected cognitive domains in a neurocognitive disorder, it must represent a decline from a previous level of performance in order to justify a diagnosis of major or mild neurocognitive disorder. Moreover, major or mild neurocognitive disorder typically has its onset in adulthood. In contrast, the inattention in ADHD must have been present prior to age 12 and does not represent a decline from previous functioning.</p>

						<ul class="number">
							<li>Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g., reads single words aloud incorrectly or slowly and hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has difficulty sounding out words).</li>
							<li>Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read text accurately but not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of what is read).</li>
							<li>Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute vowels or consonants).</li>
							<li>Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple grammatical or punctuation errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization; written expression of ideas lacks clarity).</li>
							<li>Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g., has poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships; counts on fingers to add single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in the midst of arithmetic computation and may switch procedures).</li>
							<li>Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe difficulty applying mathematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference with academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individually administered standardized achievement measures and comprehensive clinical assessment. For individuals age 17 years and older, a documented history of impairing learning difficulties may be substituted for the standardized assessment.</li>
						<li>The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully manifest until the demands for those affected academic skills exceed the individual’s limited capacities (e.g., as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a tight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).</li>
						<li>The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate educational instruction.</li>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> Specify all academic domains and subskills that are impaired. When more than one domain is impaired, each one should be coded individually according to the following specifiers.</p>
					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>F81.0 With impairment in reading:</strong>
								<br>Word reading accuracy 
								<br>Reading rate or fluency 
								<br>Reading comprehension

							</ul></p>

						<br><br><br>

						<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
						<p><strong>Normal variations in academic attainment.</strong>
							<br>Specific learning disorder is distinguished from normal variations in academic attainment attributable to external factors (e.g., lack of educational opportunity, consistently poor instruction, learning in a second language), because the learning difficulties persist in the presence of adequate educational opportunity and exposure to the same instruction as the peer group, and competency in the language of instruction, even when it is different from one’s primary spoken language.</p>
						<p><strong>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).</strong>
							<br>Specific learning disorder differs from general learning difficulties associated with intellectual developmental disorder, because the learning difficulties occur in the presence of normal levels of intellectual functioning (i.e., IQ score of at least 70 ± 5). If intellectual developmental disorder is present, specific learning disorder can be diagnosed only when the learning difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with the intellectual developmental disorder.</p>
						<p><strong>Learning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders.</strong>
							<br>Specific learning disorder is distinguished from learning difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders (e.g., pediatric stroke, traumatic brain injury, hearing impairment, vision impairment), because in these cases there are abnormal findings on neurological examination.</p>
						<p><strong>Neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
							<br>Specific learning disorder is distinguished from learning problems associated with neurodegenerative cognitive disorders. In specific learning disorder, the clinical expression of specific learning difficulties occurs during the developmental period, which sometimes only becomes evident when learning demands have increased and exceed the individual’s limited capacities (as may occur in adulthood), and the difficulties do not manifest as a marked decline from a former state.</p>
						<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
							<br>Specific learning disorder is distinguished from the poor academic performance associated with ADHD, because in the latter condition the problems may not necessarily reflect specific difficulties in learning academic skills but rather may reflect difficulties in performing those skills. However, the co-occurrence of specific learning disorder and ADHD is more frequent than expected by chance. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.</p>
						<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
							<br>Specific learning disorder is distinguished from the cognitive-processing difficulties associated with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, because with these disorders there is a decline (often rapid) in these functional domains. However, deficits in reading ability are more severe in specific learning disorder than what would be predicted by the general cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.</p>

					<h3>Developmental Coordination Disorder<br>F82</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is substantially below that expected given the individual’s chronological age and opportunity for skill learning and use. Difficulties are manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or bumping into objects) as well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills (e.g., catching an object, using scissors or cutlery, handwriting, riding a bike, or participating in sports).</li>
						<li>The motor skills deficit in Criterion A significantly and persistently interferes with activities of daily living appropriate to chronological age (e.g., self-care and self- maintenance) and impacts academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational activities, leisure, and play.</li>
						<li>Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.</li>
						<li>The motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) or visual impairment and are not attributable to a neurological condition affecting movement (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, degenerative disorder).</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Motor impairments due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Problems in coordination may be associated with visual function impairment and specific neurological disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, progressive lesions of the cerebellum, neuromuscular disorders). In such cases, there are additional findings on neurological examination.</p>
					<p><strong>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).</strong>
						<br>If intellectual developmental disorder is present, motor competences may be impaired in accordance with the intellectual disability. However, if the motor difficulties are in excess of what could be accounted for by the intellectual developmental disorder, and criteria for developmental coordination disorder are met, developmental coordination disorder can be diagnosed as well.</p>
					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with ADHD may fall, bump into objects, or knock things over. Careful observation across different contexts is required to ascertain if lack of motor competence is attributable to distractibility and impulsiveness rather than to developmental coordination disorder. If criteria for both ADHD and developmental coordination disorder are met, both diagnoses can be given.</p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may be uninterested in participating in tasks requiring complex coordination skills, such as ball sports, which will affect test performance and function but not reflect core motor competence. Co-occurrence of developmental coordination disorder and autism spectrum disorder is common. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.</p>
					<p><strong>Joint hypermobility syndrome.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with syndromes causing hyperextensible joints (found on physical examination; often with a complaint of pain) may present with symptoms similar to those of developmental coordination disorder.</p>

						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normal development.</strong>
						<br>Simple stereotypic movements are common in infancy and early childhood. Rocking may occur in the transition from sleep to awake, a behavior that usually resolves with age. Complex stereotypies are less common in typically developing children and can usually be suppressed by distraction or sensory stimulation. The individual’s daily routine is rarely affected, and the movements generally do not cause the child distress. The diagnosis would not be appropriate in these circumstances.</p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Stereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of autism spectrum disorder and should be considered when repetitive movements and behaviors are being evaluated. Deficits of social communication and reciprocity manifesting in autism spectrum disorder are generally absent in stereotypic movement disorder, and thus social interaction, social communication, and rigid repetitive behaviors and interests are distinguishing features. When autism spectrum disorder is present, stereotypic movement disorder is diagnosed only when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behaviors are sufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment.</p>
					<p><strong>Tic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Typically, stereotypies have an earlier age at onset (before 3 years) than do tics, which have a mean age at onset of 4–6 years. They also are consistent and fixed in their pattern or topography compared with tics, which are variable in their presentation, typically changing in character over time. Stereotypies may involve arms, hands, or the entire body, while tics commonly involve eyes, face, head, and shoulders. Stereotypies are more fixed, rhythmic, and prolonged in duration than tics, which, generally, are brief, rapid, random, and fluctuating. Stereotypies are ego-syntonic (children enjoy them) as opposed to tics, which are usually ego-dystonic. Tics wax and wane in location and time and are uniquely associated with premonitory urge (a physical feeling that precedes many tic movements). Tics and stereotypic movements are both reduced by distraction.</p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>Stereotypic movement disorder is distinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by the absence of obsessions, as well as by the nature of the repetitive behaviors. In OCD the individual feels driven to perform repetitive behaviors in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder the behaviors are seemingly driven but apparently purposeless. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder are characterized by body-focused repetitive behaviors (i.e., hair pulling and skin picking) that may be seemingly driven but that are not apparently purposeless, and that may not be patterned or rhythmical. Furthermore, onset in trichotillomania and excoriation disorder is not typically in the early developmental period, but rather around puberty or later.</p>
					<p><strong>Other neurological and medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of stereotypic movements requires the exclusion of habits, mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and benign hereditary chorea. A neurological history and examination are required to assess features suggestive of other disorders, such as myoclonus, dystonia, tics, and chorea. Involuntary movements associated with a neurological condition may be distinguished by their signs and symptoms. For example, repetitive, stereotypic movements in tardive dyskinesia can be distinguished by a history of chronic neuroleptic use and characteristic oral or facial dyskinesia or irregular trunk or limb movements. These types of movements do not result in self-injury. Stereotypies are a common manifestation of a variety of neurogenetic disorders, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. For stereotypic movement disorder that is associated with a known genetic or other medical condition, neurodevelopmental disorder, or environmental factor, record stereotypic movement disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or factor) (e.g., stereotypic movement disorder associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).</p>
					<p><strong>Substance-induced repetitive behaviors.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not appropriate for repetitive skin picking or scratching associated with amphetamine intoxication or abuse. In such cases, the diagnosis substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder would apply.</p>
					<p><strong>Functional (conversion) stereotypies.</strong>
						<br>Stereotyped movements must be distinguished from functional (conversion) movements. Sudden onset, distractibility, changing pattern with unexplained improvement or aggravation, and the coexistence of other symptoms of functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) are some of the typical features that help identify functional stereotypies.</p>

					</ul>
					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abnormal movements that may accompany other medical conditions, including other movement disorders.</strong>
						<br>Motor stereotypies are defined as involuntary rhythmic, repetitive, predictable movements that appear purposeful but serve no obvious adaptive function. They are often self-soothing or pleasurable and stop with distraction. Examples include repetitive hand waving/rotating, arm flapping, and finger wiggling. Motor stereotypies can usually be differentiated from tics based on the former’s earlier age at onset (often younger than 3 years), prolonged duration (seconds to minutes), being repetitive and rhythmic in form and location, lacking a premonitory sensation or urge, and cessation with distraction (e.g., hearing name called or being touched). Chorea represents rapid, random, continual, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable, nonstereotyped actions that are usually bilateral and affect all parts of the body (i.e., face, trunk, and limbs). The timing, direction, and distribution of movements vary from moment to moment, and movements usually worsen during attempted voluntary action. Dystonia is the simultaneous sustained contraction of both agonist and antagonist muscles, resulting in a distorted posture or movement of parts of the body. Dystonic postures are often triggered by attempts at voluntary movements and are not seen during sleep.</p>
					<p><strong>Paroxysmal dyskinesias.</strong>
						<br>Paroxysmal dyskinesias are characterized by episodic involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that are precipitated by voluntary movement or exertion and less commonly arise from normal background activity.</p>
					<p><strong>Myoclonus.</strong>
						<br>Myoclonus is characterized by a sudden unidirectional movement that is often nonrhythmic. It may be worsened by movement and occur during sleep. Myoclonus is differentiated from tics by its rapidity, lack of suppressibility, and absence of a premonitory sensation or urge.</p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>Differentiating compulsions in OCD from complex tics may be difficult, especially because they frequently co-occur in the same individual. The compulsions of OCD are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress and are usually performed in response to an obsession (e.g., fear of contamination). In contrast, many individuals with a tic disorder feel the need to perform the action in a particular fashion, equally on both sides of the body a certain number of times or until a "just right" feeling is achieved. Body- focused repetitive behavior disorders (i.e., persistent hair-pulling, skin-picking, nail-biting) are more goal-directed and complex than tics.</p>
					<p><strong>Functional tic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Functional disorders should also be considered when an individual presents with "tic attacks" that can go on for extended periods of time lasting from 15 minutes to several hours.</p>

							<br><strong>Note:</strong> Diagnosis of delusional disorder can be made without using this severity specifier.</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>If an individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder is completely convinced that his or her obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a diagnosis of delusional disorder. Similarly, if an individual with body dysmorphic disorder is completely convinced that his or her body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a diagnosis of delusional disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, and psychotic disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with these disorders may present with symptoms that suggest delusional disorder. For example, simple persecutory delusions in the context of major neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder cross-sectionally may be identical in symptomatology to delusional disorder but can be distinguished by the chronological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the delusional beliefs.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder.</strong>
						<br>Delusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder by the absence of the other characteristic symptoms of the active phase of schizophrenia. Furthermore, the quality of delusions can help distinguish between schizophrenia and delusional disorder. In schizophrenia, delusions show greater disorganization (the degree to which delusions are internally consistent, logical, and systematized), whereas in delusional disorder, they show greater conviction (the degree to which the individual is convinced of the reality of the delusion), greater extension (the degree to which the delusion involves various areas of the individual’s life), and greater pressure (the degree to which the individual is preoccupied and concerned with the expressed delusion).</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive and bipolar disorders and schizoaffective disorder.</strong>
						<br>These disorders may be distinguished from delusional disorder by the temporal relationship between the mood disturbance and the delusions and by the severity of the mood symptoms. If delusions occur exclusively during mood episodes, the diagnosis is major depressive or bipolar disorder, with psychotic features. Mood symptoms that meet full criteria for a mood episode can be superimposed on delusional disorder. Delusional disorder can be diagnosed only if the total duration of all mood episodes remains brief relative to the total duration of the delusional disturbance. If not, then a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder accompanied by other specified depressive disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorder, or unspecified bipolar and related disorder is appropriate.</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>A variety of medical conditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms of short duration. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a delirium is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory tests that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct physiological consequence of a specific medical condition (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, brain tumor) (see "Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition" later in this chapter).</p>
					<p><strong>Substance-related disorders.</strong>
						<br>Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, substance-induced delirium, and substance intoxication are distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the psychotic symptoms (see "Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder" later in this chapter). Laboratory tests, such as a urine drug screen or a blood alcohol level, may be helpful in making this determination, as may a careful history of substance use with attention to temporal relationships between substance intake and onset of the symptoms and to the nature of the substance being used.</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive and bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder cannot be made if the psychotic symptoms are better explained by a mood episode (i.e., the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a full major depressive, manic, or mixed episode).</p>
					<p><strong>Other psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>If the psychotic symptoms persist for 1 month or longer, the diagnosis is either schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, depressive disorder with psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, depending on the other symptoms in the presentation. The differential diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and schizophreniform disorder is difficult when the psychotic symptoms have remitted before 1 month in response to successful treatment with medication. Careful attention should be given to the possibility that a recurrent disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder, recurrent acute exacerbations of schizophrenia) may be responsible for any recurring psychotic episodes.</p>
					<p><strong>Malingering and factitious disorders.</strong>
						<br>An episode of factitious disorder with predominantly psychological signs and symptoms may have the appearance of brief psychotic disorder, but in such cases there is evidence that the symptoms are intentionally produced. When malingering involves apparently psychotic symptoms, there is usually evidence that the illness is being feigned for an understandable goal.</p>
					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>In certain individuals with personality disorders, psychosocial stressors may precipitate brief periods of psychotic symptoms. These symptoms are usually transient and do not warrant a separate diagnosis. If psychotic symptoms persist for at least 1 day, an additional diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may be appropriate.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic or catatonic features.</strong>
						<br>The distinction between schizophrenia and major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or with catatonia depends on the temporal relationship between the mood disturbance and the psychosis, and on the severity of the depressive or manic symptoms. If delusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic episode, the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizoaffective disorder.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major depressive or manic episode occur concurrently with the active-phase symptoms and that the mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration of the active periods.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>These disorders are of shorter duration than schizophrenia as specified in Criterion C, which requires 6 months of symptoms. In schizophreniform disorder, the disturbance is present less than 6 months, and in brief psychotic disorder, symptoms are present at least 1 day but less than 1 month.</p>
					<p><strong>Delusional disorder.</strong>
						<br>Delusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by the absence of the other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia (e.g., delusions, prominent auditory or visual hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms).</p>
					<p><strong>Schizotypal personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Schizotypal personality disorder may be distinguished from schizophrenia by subthreshold symptoms that are associated with persistent personality features.</p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder may present with poor or absent insight, and the preoccupations may reach delusional proportions. But these disorders are distinguished from schizophrenia by their prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance or body odor, hoarding, or body-focused repetitive behaviors.</p>
					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Posttraumatic stress disorder may include flashbacks that have a hallucinatory quality, and hypervigilance may reach paranoid proportions. But a traumatic event and characteristic symptom features relating to reliving or reacting to the event are required to make the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder or communication disorders.</strong>
						<br>These disorders may also have symptoms resembling a psychotic episode but are distinguished by their respective deficits in social interaction with repetitive and restricted behaviors and other cognitive and communication deficits. An individual with autism spectrum disorder or communication disorder must have symptoms that meet full criteria for schizophrenia, with prominent hallucinations or delusions for at least 1 month, in order to be diagnosed with schizophrenia as a comorbid condition.</p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders associated with a psychotic episode.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only when the psychotic episode is persistent and not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Individuals with a delirium or major or minor neurocognitive disorder may present with psychotic symptoms, but these would have a temporal relationship to the onset of cognitive changes consistent with those disorders.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may present with symptoms characteristic of Criterion A for schizophrenia, but the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can usually be distinguished by the chronological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the psychosis in the absence of substance use.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders and medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>A wide variety of psychiatric and medical conditions can manifest with psychotic and mood symptoms and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. These include delirium; major neurocognitive disorder; substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or neurocognitive disorder; bipolar disorders, with psychotic features; major depressive disorder, with psychotic features; depressive or bipolar disorders, with catatonic features; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality disorder; brief psychotic disorder; schizophreniform disorder; schizophrenia; delusional disorder; and other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Other medical conditions and substance use can manifest with a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition needs to be excluded.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and from depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features is often difficult. Criterion C is designed to separate schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is designed to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished from a major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features based on the presence of prominent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, the psychotic features only occur during the mood episode(s). Because the relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over time, the appropriate diagnosis may change from and to schizoaffective disorder. (For example, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode lasting 4 months during the first 6 months of a chronic psychotic illness would be changed to schizophrenia if active psychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence of another mood episode.) Achieving greater clarity about the relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms over time and about their concurrence may require collateral information from medical records and from informants.</p>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced psychotic disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is "1," and the clinician should record "mild [substance] use disorder" before the substance- induced psychotic disorder (e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate [substance] use disorder" or "severe [substance] use disorder," depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and the clinician should record only the substance-induced psychotic disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.</strong>
						<br>Individuals intoxicated with stimulants, cannabis, the opioid meperidine, or phencyclidine, or those withdrawing from alcohol or sedatives, may experience altered perceptions that they recognize as drug effects. If reality testing for these experiences remains intact (i.e., the individual recognizes that the perception is substance induced and neither believes in nor acts on it), the diagnosis is not substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Instead, substance intoxication or substance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances, is diagnosed (e.g., cocaine intoxication, with perceptual disturbances). “Flashback” hallucinations that can occur long after the use of hallucinogens has stopped are diagnosed as hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. If substance/medication-induced psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium, as in severe forms of alcohol withdrawal, the psychotic symptoms are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately. Delusions in the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance.</p>
					<p><strong>Independent psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from an independent psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, by the fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms. </p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or medical condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if there is a withdrawal syndrome associated with the medication). Because individuals with medical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician must consider the possibility that the psychotic symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the medical condition itself rather than the medication, in which case psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically for that individual whether the medication is the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is attributable to both a medical condition and substance/medication use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) may be given.</p>
					<p><strong>Other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>The psychotic symptoms included in the diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder are limited to either delusions or hallucinations. Individuals with other substance-induced psychotic symptoms (e.g., disorganized or catatonic behavior; disorganized speech; incoherence or irrational content) should be classified in the category other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.</p>

					</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Delirium and major or mild neurocognitive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Hallucinations and delusions commonly occur in the context of a delirium; a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the delusions and/or hallucinations occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. On the other hand, a diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major or mild neurocognitive disorder if the delusions or hallucinations are judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder (e.g., psychotic disorder due to Lewy body disease, with delusions).</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance or medication that can cause psychotic symptoms on withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin (e.g., LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] intoxication, alcohol withdrawal), a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks) of substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance-induced psychotic disorder, depending on the character, duration, or amount of the substance used. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) can be given.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition must be distinguished from a psychotic disorder that is not due to another medical condition (e.g., schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder) or a major depressive or bipolar disorder, with psychotic features. In psychotic disorders and in depressive or bipolar disorders, with psychotic features, no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be demonstrated. Late age at onset and the absence of a personal or family history of schizophrenia or delusional disorder suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Auditory hallucinations that involve voices speaking complex sentences are more characteristic of schizophrenia than of psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. While certain symptoms suggest a medical or toxic etiology (e.g., visual or olfactory hallucinations, dreamlike quality of delusions [individual as uninvolved observer]), there are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms that unequivocally point clinicians either way. Visual hallucinations are not uncommon in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and olfactory hallucinations (e.g., unpleasant smells) are also consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Thus, clinicians should not give undue weight to any one particular hallucination alone when deciding between a psychiatric and a medical cause for psychopathology.</p>

						<p>A separate diagnosis of catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the catatonia occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium or neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

If the individual is currently taking neuroleptic medication, consideration should be given to medication-induced movement disorders (e.g., abnormal positioning may be due to neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (e.g., catatonic-like features may be present, along with associated vital sign and/or laboratory abnormalities). Catatonic symptoms may be present in any of the following five psychotic disorders: brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. It may also be present in some of the neurodevelopmental disorders, in all of the bipolar and depressive disorders, and in other mental disorders.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>There is a risk of misdiagnosing bipolar I disorder as unipolar depression because of the prominence of depression in the presentation of bipolar I disorder: 1) the first episode of bipolar disorder is often depressive, 2) depressive symptoms are the most frequent symptoms experienced across the long-term course of bipolar I disorder, and 3) the problem for which individuals typically seek help is depression. When the individual presents in an episode of major depression, it is therefore important to actively probe for a history of mania or hypomania. Factors that might indicate that the diagnosis is bipolar I disorder rather than major depressive disorder in an individual presenting with a current depressive episode include family history of bipolar disorder, onset of illness in early 20s, numerous past episodes, presence of psychotic symptoms, and a history of lack of response to antidepressant treatment or the emergence of a manic episode during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy).</p>
					<p><strong>Other bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>Bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder, and other specified bipolar and related disorder are similar to bipolar I disorder by virtue of their including periods of hypomanic symptoms in their presentations but are differentiated from bipolar I disorder by the absence of any manic episodes.</p>
					<p><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other anxiety disorders.</strong>
						<br>A careful history of symptoms is needed to differentiate generalized anxiety disorder from bipolar disorder, as anxious ruminations may be mistaken for racing thoughts (and vice versa), and efforts to minimize anxious feelings may be taken as impulsive behavior. Similarly, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder need to be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is helpful to assess the episodic nature of the symptoms described (classical bipolar I is episodic), as well as to consider symptom triggers, in making this differential diagnosis.</p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition should be made instead of bipolar I disorder if the manic episodes are judged, based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination, to be the direct physiological consequence of another medical condition (e.g., Cushing’s disease, multiple sclerosis).</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from bipolar I disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., stimulants, phencyclidine) or medication (e.g., steroids) is judged to be etiologically related to the manic episode. Because individuals with a manic episode have a tendency to overuse substances during an episode, it is important to determine whether the substance use is a consequence of a primary manic episode or whether the manic-like episode has been caused by the substance use. In some cases, a definitive diagnosis may involve establishing that the manic symptoms remain once the individual is no longer using the substance. Note that manic episodes emerging in the context of treatment with an antidepressant medication but that persist at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of the medication warrant a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder rather than substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizoaffective disorder.</strong>
						<br>Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by periods in which manic and major depressive episodes are concurrent with the active phase symptoms of schizophrenia and periods in which delusions or hallucinations occur for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a manic or major depressive episode. The diagnosis is “bipolar I disorder, with psychotic features” if the psychotic symptoms have occurred exclusively during manic and major depressive episodes.</p>
					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which may resemble the symptoms of a manic episode (e.g., distractibility, increased activity, impulsive behavior) and have their onset by age 12. In contrast, the symptoms of mania in bipolar I disorder occur in distinct episodes and typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood.</p>
					<p><strong>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.</strong>
						<br>In individuals with severe irritability, particularly children and adolescents, care must be taken to apply the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder only to those who have had a clear episode of mania or hypomania—that is, a distinct time period, of the required duration, during which the irritability was clearly different from the individual’s baseline and was accompanied by the onset of the other characteristic symptoms of mania (e.g., grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, involvement in activities with a high potential for painful consequences). When a child’s irritability is persistent and particularly severe, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder would be more appropriate. Indeed, when any child is being assessed for mania, it is essential that the symptoms represent a clear change from the child’s typical behavior.</p>
					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder may have substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar I disorder, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both conditions. In order to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, symptoms of mood lability and impulsivity must represent a distinct episode of illness, or there must be a noticeable increase in these symptoms over the individual’s baseline in order to justify an additional diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.</p>

					<h3>Bipolar II Disorder<br>F31.81</h3>
					<p>For a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria for a current or past hypomanic episode and the following criteria for a current or past major depressive episode:</p>

							<li>During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:</li>
							<ul class="number">
								<li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.</li>
								<li>Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).</li>
								<li>More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.</li>
								<li>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.</li>
								<li>Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.</li>
								<li>Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.</li>
								<li>Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).</li>
							</ul>
							<li>The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.</li>
							<li>The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.</li>
							<li>The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.</li>
							<li>The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition.<br><strong>Note:</strong> A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis.</li>

Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Major depressive disorder is characterized by the absence of both manic episodes and hypomanic episodes. Given that the presence of some manic or hypomanic symptoms (e.g., fewer symptoms or shorter duration than required for hypomania) may still be compatible with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, it is important to ascertain whether the symptoms meet criteria for a hypomanic episode to determine whether it is more appropriate to make the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. Depressive episodes dominate the overall course of illness for most individuals with bipolar II disorder, contributing to the decade-long lag between illness onset and the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. Because the diagnostic criteria for major depressive episode are identical in major depressive disorder and bipolar II disorder, the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made only by eliciting information about at least one prior hypomanic episode in order to distinguish the bipolar II disorder from major depressive disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Cyclothymic disorder.</strong>
						<br>In cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet symptom or duration criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet symptom or duration criteria for a major depressive episode. Bipolar II disorder is distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the presence of one or more hypomanic episodes and one or more major depressive episodes.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizophrenia.</strong>
						<br>Schizophrenia is characterized by active-phase psychotic symptoms that may be accompanied by major depressive episodes. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made if no major depressive episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms. If they have occurred concurrently, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is made if the major depressive episodes have been present for only a minority of the time. The diagnosis is bipolar II disorder, with psychotic features, if the psychotic symptoms have occurred exclusively during major depressive episodes.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizoaffective disorder.</strong>
						<br>Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by periods in which depressive symptoms are concurrent with the active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia and periods in which delusions or hallucinations occur for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major depressive episode. The diagnosis is bipolar II disorder, with psychotic features, if the psychotic symptoms have occurred exclusively during major depressive episodes.</p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition should be made instead of bipolar II disorder if the hypomanic episodes are judged, based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination, to be the direct physiological consequence of another medical condition (e.g., Cushing’s disease, multiple sclerosis).</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from bipolar II disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., stimulants, phencyclidine) or medication (e.g., steroids) is judged to be etiologically related to the hypomanic and major depressive episodes. Because individuals with a hypomanic episode have a tendency to overuse substances during an episode, it is important to determine whether the substance use is a consequence of a primary hypomanic episode or whether the hypomanic- like episode has been caused by the substance use. In some cases, a definitive diagnosis may involve establishing that the hypomanic symptoms or depressive symptoms remain once the individual is no longer using the substance. Note that hypomanic episodes emerging in the context of treatment with an antidepressant medication but persisting at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of the medication warrant a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder rather than substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be misdiagnosed as bipolar II disorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many symptoms of ADHD, such as excessive talking, distractibility, and less need for sleep, overlap with the symptoms of hypomania. The double counting of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar II disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the symptoms represent a distinct episode and if the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is present.</p>
					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>The same convention as applies for ADHD also applies when evaluating an individual for a personality disorder such as borderline personality disorder because mood lability and impulsivity are common in both personality disorders and bipolar II disorder. Symptoms must represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder must be present. A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode unless the lifetime history supports the presence of a personality disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Other bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>Diagnosis of bipolar II disorder should be differentiated from bipolar I disorder by carefully considering whether there have been any past episodes of mania and from other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders by confirming the presence of fully syndromal hypomania and depression.</p>

					<h3>Cyclothymic Disorder<br>F34.0</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode.</li>
						<li>During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents), Criterion A symptoms have been present for at least half the time and the individual has not been without the symptoms for more than 2 months at a time.</li>

						<li>The symptoms in Criterion A are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.</li>
						<li>The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).</li>

						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition is made when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable to the physiological effect of a specific, usually chronic medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). This determination is based on the history, physical examination, and/or laboratory findings. If it is judged that the hypomanic and depressive symptoms are not the physiological consequence of the medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (i.e., cyclothymic disorder) and the medical condition are coded. For example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are considered to be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a chronic medical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship between the hypomanic and depressive symptoms and the medical condition.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the judgment that a substance/medication (especially stimulants) is etiologically related to the mood disturbance. The frequent mood swings in these disorders that are suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually resolve following cessation of substance/medication use.</p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling, and bipolar II disorder, with rapid cycling.</strong>
						<br>Both disorders may resemble cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the frequent marked shifts in mood. By definition, in cyclothymic disorder the criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met, whereas the bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder specifier “with rapid cycling” requires that full mood episodes be present.</p>
					<p><strong>Borderline personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Borderline personality disorder is associated with recurrent, brief marked shifts in mood that may suggest cyclothymic disorder. Engagement in potentially self- damaging behaviors can be seen in both conditions but would need to occur in the context of other hypomanic symptoms to be related to cyclothymia. Mood instability in borderline personality disorder occurs in the domains of anxiety, irritability, and sadness, whereas elation, euphoria, and/or increased energy are not characteristic features of borderline personality disorder. If the criteria are met for both disorders, both borderline personality disorder and cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed.</p>

					<h3>Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy.</li>
						<li>There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):</li>
						<ul class="number">

						<li>The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.</li>
						<li>The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>

					<p><strong>Note:</strong> This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced bipolar and related disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10- CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p>Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder should be differentiated from other bipolar disorders, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, substance-induced delirium, and medication side effects (as noted earlier). A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar I diagnosis. A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar II diagnosis only if preceded by a major depressive episode.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal.</strong>
						<br>Euphoria, irritability, and increased energy may occur in substance intoxication (e.g., stimulant intoxication) or substance withdrawal (e.g., cannabis withdrawal). The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder either with onset during intoxication or with onset during withdrawal should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the euphoric or irritable mood or increased energy symptoms are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.</p>

						<li>The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, or necessitates hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below).<br>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>F06.33 With manic features:</strong> Full criteria are not met for a manic or hypomanic episode.</li>
							<li><strong>F06.33 With manic- or hypomanic-like episode:</strong> Full criteria are met except Criterion D for a manic episode or except Criterion F for a hypomanic episode.</li>
							<li><strong>F06.34 With mixed features:</strong> Symptoms of depression are also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture.</li>
						</ul></p>
					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., F06.33 bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately before the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., E05.90 hyperthyroidism; F06.33 bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features).</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Delirium and major or mild neurocognitive disorder.</strong>
						<br>A separate diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the mood disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major or mild neurocognitive disorder if the mood disturbance is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder and if symptoms of irritability or elevated mood are a prominent part of the clinical presentation.</p>
					<p><strong>Symptoms of catatonia and acute anxiety.</strong>
						<br>It is important to differentiate symptoms of mania from excited catatonic symptoms and from agitation related to acute anxiety states.</p>
					<p><strong>Medication-induced depressive or manic symptoms.</strong>
						<br>An important differential diagnostic observation is that the other medical condition may be treated with medications (e.g., steroids or alpha- interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment using all of the evidence in hand is the best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs. a substance/medication-induced syndrome). The differential diagnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the present manual.</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder<br>F31.89</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific bipolar and related disorder. This is done by recording “other specified bipolar and related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration cyclothymia”).</p>

					<p>Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:
						<ul class="number">
							<li><strong>Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2–3 days) and major depressive episodes:</strong> A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced two or more episodes of short- duration hypomania that meet the full symptomatic criteria for a hypomanic episode but that only last for 2–3 days. The episodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features.</li>
							<li><strong>Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive episodes:</strong> A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced one or more episodes of hypomania that do not meet full symptomatic criteria (i.e., at least 4 consecutive days of elevated mood and one or two of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode, or irritable mood and two or three of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features.</li>
							<li><strong>Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode:</strong> One or more hypomanic episodes in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic episode.</li>
							<li><strong>Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months):</strong> Multiple episodes of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and multiple episodes of depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode that persist over a period of less than 24 months (less than 12 months for children or adolescents) in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and does not meet criteria for any psychotic disorder. During the course of the disorder, the hypomanic or depressive symptoms are present for more days than not, the individual has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months at a time, and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment.</li>
							<li><strong>Manic episode superimposed</strong> on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. <strong>Note:</strong> Manic episodes that are part of schizoaffective disorder do not merit an additional diagnosis of other specified bipolar and related disorder.</li>

					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific bipolar and related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).</p>

					<h3>Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders</h3>
					<p>Specify if:
						<ul>
							<li><p><strong>With anxious distress:</strong> The presence of at least two of the following symptoms during the majority of days of the current manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode in bipolar I disorder (or the most recent episode if bipolar I disorder is in partial or full remission); or of the current hypomanic or major depressive episode in bipolar II disorder (or the most recent episode if bipolar II disorder is in partial or full remission); or during the majority of symptomatic days in cyclothymic disorder:</p>
								<ul class="number">
									<li>Feeling keyed up or tense.</li>
									<li>Feeling unusually restless.</li>
									<li>Difficulty concentrating because of worry.</li>
									<li>Fear that something awful may happen.</li>
									<li>Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself.</li>
									<p>Specify current severity:</p>
									<ul class="specifier">
										<li><strong>Mild:</strong> Two symptoms.</li>
										<li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Three symptoms.</li>
										<li><strong>Moderate-severe:</strong> Four or five symptoms.</li>
										<li><strong>Severe:</strong> Four or five symptoms with motor agitation.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong>Note:</strong> Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorders in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.</p>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li><strong>With mixed features:</strong> The mixed features specifier can apply to the current manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode in bipolar I disorder (or the most recent episode if bipolar I disorder is in partial or full remission) or to the current hypomanic or major depressive episode in bipolar II disorder (or the most recent episode if bipolar II disorder is in partial or full remission):
								<ul>
									<p><strong>Manic or hypomanic episode, with mixed features:</strong></p>
									<ul class="upperAlhpa">
										<li>Full criteria are met for a manic episode or hypomanic episode, and at least three of the following symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania or hypomania:</li>
										<ul class="number">
											<li>Prominent dysphoria or depressed mood as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful).</li>
											<li>Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others).</li>
											<li>Psychomotor retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not merely subjective feelings of being slowed down).</li>
											<li>Fatigue or loss of energy.</li>
											<li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).</li>
											<li>Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person’s usual behavior.</li>
										<li>For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features, due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full mania.</li>
										<li>The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).</li>
									</ul>

									<p><strong>Depressive episode, with mixed features:</strong></p>
									<ul class="upperAlhpa">
										<li>Full criteria are met for a major depressive episode, and at least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of depression:</li>
										<ul class="number">
											<li>Elevated, expansive mood.</li>
											<li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.</li>
											<li>More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.</li>
											<li>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.</li>
											<li>Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually).</li>
											<li>Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).</li>
											<li>Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia).</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person’s usual behavior.</li>
										<li>For individuals whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features.</li>
										<li>The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).</li>
										<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.</p>
									</ul>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With rapid cycling:</strong> Presence of at least four mood episodes in the previous 12 months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode in bipolar I disorder or that meet the criteria for hypomanic or major depressive episode in bipolar II disorder.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Note:</strong> Episodes are demarcated by either partial or full remissions of at least 2 months or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity (e.g., major depressive episode to manic episode).</li>
								<li><strong>Note:</strong> The essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is the occurrence of at least four mood episodes during the previous 12 months. These episodes can occur in any combination and order. The episodes must meet both the duration and the symptom number criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and must be demarcated by either a period of full remission or a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity. Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on the same pole. Except for the fact that they occur more frequently, the episodes that occur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no different from those that occur in a non-rapid- cycling pattern. Mood episodes that count toward defining a rapid-cycling pattern exclude those episodes directly caused by a substance (e.g., cocaine, corticosteroids) or another medical condition.</li>
							</ul>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With melancholic features:</strong>
								<ul class="upperAlhpa">
									<li>One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if bipolar I or bipolar II disorder is currently in partial or full remission):</li>
									<ul class="number">
										<li>Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.</li>
										<li>Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens).</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Three (or more) of the following:</li>
									<ul class="number">
										<li>A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.</li>
										<li>Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.</li>
										<li>Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).</li>
										<li>Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.</li>
										<li>Significant anorexia or weight loss.</li>
										<li>Excessive or inappropriate guilt.
											<br><strong>Note:</strong>  The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are present at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near- complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%– 40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always present and are observable by others.<br>Melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are more likely to occur in individuals with psychotic features.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
							</p></li>

							<li>
								<p><strong>With atypical features:</strong> This specifier is applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if bipolar I or bipolar II disorder is currently in partial or full remission).</p>
								<ul class="upperAlhpa">
									<li>Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events).</li>
									<li>Two (or more) of the following:</li>
									<ul class="number">
										<li>Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.</li>
										<li>Hypersomnia.</li>
										<li>Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).</li>
										<li>A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the same episode.
										<br><strong>Note:</strong> “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression that were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.<br>Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become euthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With psychotic features:</strong> Delusions or hallucinations are present at any time in the current manic or major depressive episode in bipolar I disorder (or the most recent manic or major depressive episode if bipolar I disorder is currently in partial or full remission) or in the current major depressive episode in bipolar II disorder (or the most recent major depressive episode if bipolar II disorder is currently in partial or full remission). If psychotic features are present, specify if mood-congruent or mood-incongruent:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>When applied to current or most recent manic episode (in bipolar I disorder):</li>
									<ul class="specifier">
										<li><strong>With mood-congruent psychotic features:</strong> The content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical manic themes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc., but may also include themes of suspiciousness or paranoia, especially with respect to others’ doubts about the individual’s capacities, accomplishments, and so forth.</li>
										<li><strong>With mood-incongruent psychotic features:</strong> The content of the delusions and hallucinations does not involve typical manic themes as described above, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>When applied to current or most recent major depressive episode (in bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder):</li>
									<ul class="specifier">
										<li><strong>With mood-congruent psychotic features:</strong> The content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment.</li>
										<li><strong>With mood-incongruent psychotic features:</strong> The content of the delusions and hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With catatonia:</strong> This specifier is applied to the current manic or major depressive episode in bipolar I disorder (or the most recent manic or major depressive episode if bipolar I disorder is currently in partial or full remission) or to the current major depressive episode in bipolar II disorder (or the most recent major depressive episode if bipolar II disorder is currently in partial or full remission) if catatonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental disorder in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders.”</p></li>

							<li><p><strong>With peripartum onset:</strong> This specifier is applied to the current manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode in bipolar I disorder (or the most recent manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode if bipolar I disorder is currently in partial or full remission) or to the current hypomanic or major depressive episode in bipolar II disorder (or the most recent hypomanic or major depressive episode if bipolar II disorder is currently in partial or full remission) if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery.</p>
								<ul><p>
									<strong>Note:</strong> Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum. About 50% of postpartum major depressive episodes begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes.
									<br>Between conception and birth, about 9% of women will experience a major depressive episode. The best estimate for prevalence of a major depressive episode between birth and 12 months postpartum is just below 7%.
									<br>Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic features. Infanticide (a rare occurrence) is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.
									<br>Postpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is particularly increased for women with prior postpartum psychotic mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.
									<br>Once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period, which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention.
									<br>Peripartum-onset depressive disorders must be distinguished from the much more common “maternity blues,” or what is known in lay terms as “baby blues.” Maternity blues is not considered to be a mental disorder and is characterized by sudden changes in mood (e.g., the sudden onset of tearfulness in the absence of depression) that do not cause functional impairment and that are likely caused by physiological changes occurring after delivery. It is temporary and self-limited, typically improving quickly (within a week) without the need for treatment. Other symptoms of maternity blues include sleep disturbance and even confusion that can occur shortly after delivery.
									<br>Perinatal women may be at higher risk for depressive disorders due to thyroid abnormalities as well as other medical conditions that can cause depressive symptoms. If the depressive symptoms are judged to be due to another medical condition related to the perinatal period, depressive disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed instead of a major depressive episode, with peripartum onset.
								</p></ul>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With seasonal pattern:</strong> This specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of mood episodes. The essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at least one type of episode (i.e., mania, hypomania, or depression). The other types of episodes may not follow this pattern. For example, an individual may have seasonal manias but have depressions that do not regularly occur at a specific time of year.</p>
								<ul class="upperAlhpa">
									<li>There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.<br><strong>Note:</strong> Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).</li>
									<li>Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania or vice versa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring).</li>
									<li>In the last 2 years, the individual’s manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes have demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no nonseasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that 2-year period.</li>
									<li>Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described above) substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The specifier “with seasonal pattern” can apply to the pattern of major depressive episodes in bipolar I and bipolar II disorder, to the pattern of manic episodes and hypomanic episodes in bipolar I disorder, and to the pattern of hypomanic episodes in bipolar II disorder. The essential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episodes at characteristic times of the year. In most cases, the seasonal major depressive episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive, manic, or hypomanic episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive, manic, or hypomanic episodes over the individual’s lifetime.
									<br>This specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better explained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or school schedule). It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern of major depressive episodes is more likely in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar disorders group, a seasonal pattern of major depressive episodes appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season, with peak seasonality of mania or hypomania from spring through summer.
									<br>The prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of seasonality, with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes.</li>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong>
					Because chronically irritable children and adolescents typically present with complex histories, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be made while considering the presence or absence of multiple other conditions. Despite the need to consider many other syndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder requires particularly careful assessment.</p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child’s usual mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by the onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child’s usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child’s mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. In contrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while bipolar disorders are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In fact, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Oppositional defiant disorder.</strong>
						<br>While symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typically do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are relatively rare in children with oppositional defiant disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. In addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. For this reason, while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with oppositional defiant disorder would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. Moreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the prominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and the high risk for depressive and anxiety disorders in follow-up studies justify placement of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder among the depressive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional defiant disorder is included in the chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders.”) This reflects the more prominent mood component among individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. Nevertheless, it also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood problems.</p>
					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Unlike children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or oppositional defiant disorder—for whom a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be given even if the symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for that disorder—children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may have symptoms that also meet criteria for an anxiety disorder and can receive both diagnoses, but children whose irritability is manifest only in the context of exacerbation of an anxiety disorder should receive the relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. In addition, children with autism spectrum disorders frequently present with temper outbursts when, for example, their routines are disturbed. In that instance, the temper outbursts would be considered secondary to the autism spectrum disorder, and the child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Intermittent explosive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Children with symptoms suggestive of intermittent explosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outbursts, much like children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However, unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require the individual’s mood to be persistently irritable or angry between outbursts. In addition, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder involving verbal aggression or physical aggression that does not result in damage to property or physical injury to animals or other individuals occurring at least twice weekly can be made after only 3 months of symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made.</p>

Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.</li>

Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows:</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Manic episodes with irritable mood or with mixed features.</strong>
						<br>Major depressive episodes with prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with irritable mood or with mixed features. This distinction requires a careful clinical evaluation of the presence of sufficient manic symptoms to meet threshold criteria (i.e., three if mood is manic, four if mood is irritable but not manic).</p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or other specified bipolar and related disorder.</strong>
						<br>Major depressive episodes along with a history of a manic or hypomanic episode preclude the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Major depressive episodes with a history of hypomanic episodes and without a history of manic episodes indicate a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, whereas major depressive episodes with a history of manic episodes (with or without hypomanic episodes) indicate a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. On the other hand, presentations of major depressive episodes with a history of periods of hypomania that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode may be diagnosed as either other specified bipolar and related disorder or major depressive disorder depending on where the clinician judges the presentation to best fall. For example, the presentation may be best considered other specified bipolar and related disorder because of the clinical significance of the subthreshold hypomanic symptoms, or the presentation may be best considered a case of major depressive disorder with some subthreshold hypomanic symptoms in between episodes.</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of depressive disorder due to another medical condition requires the presence of an etiological medical condition. Major depressive disorder is not diagnosed if the major depressive–like episodes are all attributable to the direct pathophysiological consequence of a specific medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>This disorder is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For example, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Persistent depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by depressed mood, more days than not, for at least 2 years. If criteria are met for both major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, both can be diagnosed.</p>
					<p><strong>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder.</strong>
						<br>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is characterized by dysphoric mood that is present in the final week before the onset of menses, that starts to improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and that becomes minimal or absent in the week postmenses. By contrast, the episodes of major depressive disorder are not temporally connected to the menstrual cycle.</p>
					<p><strong>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.</strong>
						<br>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by severe, recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally and/or behaviorally, accompanied by persistent or labile mood, most of the day, nearly every day, in between the outbursts. In contrast, in major depressive disorder, irritability is confined to the major depressive episodes.</p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive episodes superimposed on schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Depressive symptoms may be present during schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. Most commonly, such depressive symptoms can be considered associated features of these disorders and do not merit a separate diagnosis. However, when the depressive symptoms meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder may be made in addition to the diagnosis of the psychotic disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizoaffective disorder.</strong>
						<br>Schizoaffective disorder differs from major depressive disorder, with psychotic features, by the requirement that in schizoaffective disorder, delusions or hallucinations are present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major depressive episode.</p>
					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Distractibility and low frustration tolerance can occur in both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a major depressive episode; if the criteria are met for both, ADHD may be diagnosed in addition to the mood disorder. However, the clinician must be cautious not to overdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with ADHD whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness or loss of interest.</p>
					<p><strong>Adjustment disorder with depressed mood.</strong>
						<br>A major depressive episode that occurs in response to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, by the fact that the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in adjustment disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Bereavement.</strong>
						<br>Bereavement is the experience of losing a loved one to death. It generally triggers a grief response that may be intense and may involve many features that overlap with symptoms characteristic of a major depressive episode, such as sadness, difficulty sleeping, and poor concentration. Features that help differentiate a bereavement-related grief response from a major depressive episode include the following: the predominant affects in grief are feelings of emptiness and loss, whereas in a major depressive episode they are persistent depressed mood and a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Moreover, the dysphoric mood of grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves that tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased, whereas the depressed mood in a major depressive episode is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. It is important to note that in a vulnerable individual (e.g., someone with a past history of major depressive disorder), bereavement may trigger not only a grief response but also the development of an episode of depression or the worsening of an existing episode.</p>
					<p><strong>Sadness.</strong>
						<br>Finally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience. These periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless criteria are met for severity (i.e., five out of nine symptoms), duration (i.e., most of the day, nearly every day for at least 2 weeks), and clinically significant distress or impairment. The diagnosis other specified depressive disorder may be appropriate for presentations of depressed mood with clinically significant impairment that do not meet criteria for duration or severity.</p>

					<p><strong>Note:</strong> If criteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during the 2-year period of depressed mood, then a separate diagnosis of major depression should be made in addition to the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder along with the relevant specifier (e.g., with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode).</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>If there is a depressed mood for more days than not plus two or more persistent depressive disorder Criterion B symptoms for 2 years or more, then the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is made. If the symptom criteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this period, then the additional diagnosis of major depression should be made. The comorbid presence of major depressive episodes during this period should also be noted by assigning the appropriate course specifier to the persistent depressive disorder diagnosis as follows: If the individual’s symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, and there have been periods of at least 8 weeks in at least the preceding 2 years with symptoms below the threshold for a full major depressive episode, then the specifier “with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode” would be assigned. If full criteria for a major depressive episode are not currently met but there has been one or more major depressive episodes in at least the preceding 2 years, then the specifier “with intermittent major depressive episodes, without current episode” is assigned. If a major depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and remains present, then the specifier “with persistent major depressive episode” is used. If the individual has not experienced an episode of major depression in the last 2 years, then the specifier “with pure dysthymic syndrome” is used.</p>
					<p><strong>Other specified depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include symptoms (i.e., markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities; psychomotor agitation or retardation; recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt or plan) that are absent from the symptom list for persistent depressive disorder (i.e., depressed mood and two out of six Criterion B symptoms), a very limited number of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer than 2 years but that do not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met at some point during the current episode of illness, a diagnosis of major depressive disorder would apply. Otherwise, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder should be given.</p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar I and bipolar II disorders.</strong>
						<br>A history of a manic or hypomanic episode precludes the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. A history of manic episodes (with or without hypomanic episodes) indicates a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. A history of hypomanic episodes (without any history of manic episodes in individuals with persistent depressive presentations during which criteria have been met for a major depressive episode) warrants a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. Other specified bipolar disorder applies to individuals whose presentations include a history of hypomanic episodes along with persistent depressive presentation that has never met full criteria for a major depressive episode.</p>
					<p><strong>Cyclothymic disorder.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder precludes the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. Thus, if during the period lasting at least 2 years of depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, 1) there are numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode, 2) there have not been any symptom-free periods of more than 2 months at a time, and 3) criteria have never been met for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode, then the diag-nosis would be cyclothymic disorder instead of persistent depressive disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Depressive symptoms are a common associated feature of chronic psychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A separate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur only during the course of the psychotic disorder (including residual phases).</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Persistent depressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on history, physical examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the direct pathophysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic, medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis). If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g., persistent depressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition is noted as a concomitant medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from persistent depressive disorder when a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.</p>
					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>A personality disorder is characterized by an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture, with onset by adolescence or early adulthood. Personality disorders commonly co-occur with persistent depressive disorder. If criteria are met for persistent depressive disorder and a personality disorder, both may be diagnosed.</p>

					<h3>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder<br>F32.81</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week postmenses.</li>
						<li>One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:</li>
						<ul class="number">

							<li>Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts.</li>

							<li>Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present, to reach a total of five symptoms when combined with symptoms from Criterion B above.</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies).</li>
							<li>Subjective difficulty in concentration.</li>
							<li>Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.</li>

							<li>Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Note:</strong> The symptoms in Criteria A–C must have been met for most menstrual cycles that occurred in the preceding year.</p>
						<li>The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or interference with work, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of social activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive disorder, or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with any of these disorders).</li>
						<li>Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two symptomatic cycles. (<strong>Note:</strong> The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.)</li>
						<li>The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Premenstrual syndrome.</strong>
						<br>Premenstrual syndrome differs from premenstrual dysphoric disorder in that premenstrual syndrome does not require a minimum of five symptoms nor mood-related symptomatology, and it is generally considered to be less severe than premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Premenstrual syndrome may be more common than premenstrual dysphoric disorder; its estimated prevalence varies with numbers that hover at about 20%. While premenstrual syndrome shares the feature of symptom expression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, the presence of somatic or behavioral symptoms, without the required affective symptoms, likely meets criteria for premenstrual syndrome and not for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Dysmenorrhea.</strong>
						<br>Dysmenorrhea is a syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from a syndrome characterized by affective changes. Moreover, symptoms of dysmenorrhea begin with the onset of menses, whereas symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by definition, begin before the onset of menses, even if they linger into the first few days of menses.</p>
					<p><strong>Bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and persistent depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Many women with (either naturally occurring or substance/medication-induced) bipolar or major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder believe that they have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. However, when they chart symptoms, they realize that the symptoms do not follow a premenstrual pattern. Because the onset of menses constitutes a memorable event, they may report that symptoms occur only during the premenstruum or that symptoms worsen premenstrually. This is one of the rationales for the requirement that symptoms be confirmed by daily prospective ratings. The process of differential diagnosis, particularly if the clinician relies on retrospective symptoms only, is made more difficult because of the overlap between symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and some other diagnoses. The overlap of symptoms is particularly salient for differentiating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major depressive episodes, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and borderline personality disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Use of hormonal treatments.</strong>
						<br>Some women who present with moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms may be using hormonal treatments, including hormonal contraceptives. If such symptoms occur after initiation of exogenous hormone use, the symptoms may be attributable to the use of hormones rather than to the underlying condition of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. If the woman stops hormones and the symptoms disappear, then this is consistent with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Women with chronic medical conditions may experience symptoms of premenstrual dysphoria. As with any depressive disorder, medical conditions that could better account for the symptoms should be ruled out, such as thyroid deficiency and anemia.</p>

				<div id="Ch4_5" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.</li>
						<li>There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to or withdrawal from a medication.</li>
							<li>The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could include the following:<br>The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced depressive disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication- related episodes).</li>
						<li>The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.</li>
						<li>The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.</p>
					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced depressive disorder.</p>

					<p>Specify (see Table 1 in the chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders," which indicates whether "with onset during intoxication" and/or "with onset during withdrawal" applies to a given substance class; or specify "with onset after medication use"):
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>With onset during intoxication:</strong> If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.</li>
							<li><strong>With onset during withdrawal:</strong> If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.</li>
							<li><strong>With onset after medication use:</strong> If symptoms developed at initiation of medication, with a change in use of medication, or during withdrawal of medication.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Substance intoxication and withdrawal.</strong>
						<br> Depressive symptoms occur commonly in substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. A diagnosis of substance-induced depressive disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, dysphoric mood is a characteristic feature of cocaine withdrawal. Substance-induced depressive disorder with onset during withdrawal should be diagnosed instead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood disturbance in Criterion A predominates in the clinical picture and is sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and treatment.</p>
					<p><strong>Independent depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from an independent depressive disorder by the fact that even though a substance is taken in high enough amounts to be possibly etiologically related to the symptoms, if the depressive syndrome is observed at times other than when the substance or medication is being used, it should be diagnosed as an independent depressive disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Because individuals with medical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician must consider the possibility that the mood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the medical condition rather than the medication, in which case depressive disorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically whether the medication is the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both another medical condition and substance use or withdrawal, then both diagnoses (i.e., depressive disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the depressive symptoms are associated with substance (including a medication) ingestion or withdrawal or with another medical condition or are independent (i.e., not a function of either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder is indicated.</p>

				<div id="Ch4_6" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.</li>
						<li>There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a serious medical condition).</li>
						<li>The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.</li>
						<li>The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below).
						<br>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>F06.31 With depressive features:</strong> Full criteria are not met for a major depressive episode.</li>
							<li><strong>F06.32 With major depressive–like episode:</strong> Full criteria are met (except Criterion C) for a major depressive episode.</li>
							<li><strong>F06.34 With mixed features:</strong> Symptoms of mania or hypomania are also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., F06.31 depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately before the depressive disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., E03.9 hypothyroidism; F06.31 depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features).</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Depressive disorders not due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Determination of whether a medical condition accompanying a depressive disorder is causing the disorder depends on a) the absence of an episode(s) of depressive episodes prior to the onset of the medical condition, b) the probability that the associated medical condition has a potential to promote or cause a depressive disorder, and c) a course of the depressive symptoms shortly after the onset or worsening of the medical condition, especially if the depressive symptoms remit near the time that the medical disorder is effectively treated or remits.</p>
					<p><strong>Medication-induced depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>An important caveat is that some medical conditions are treated with medications (e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment, based on all the evidence in hand, is the best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs. a substance-induced syndrome).</p>
					<p><strong>Delirium and major or mild neurocognitive disorder.</strong>
						<br>A separate diagnosis of depressive disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the depressive disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of depressive disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major or mild neurocognitive disorder if the depressive disturbance is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder and if symptoms of depression are a prominent part of the clinical presentation.</p>
					<p><strong>Adjustment disorders.</strong>
						<br>It is important to differentiate a depressive episode from an adjustment disorder, as the onset of the medical condition is in itself a life stressor that could bring on either an adjustment disorder or an episode of major depression. The major differentiating elements are the pervasiveness of the depressive picture and the number and quality of the depressive symptoms that the individual reports or demonstrates on the mental status examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the present manual.</p>
					<p><strong>Demoralization.</strong>
						<br>Demoralization is a common reaction to chronic medical illness. It is marked by a sense of subjective incompetence, helplessness, and hopelessness, and a desire to give up. It is often accompanied by depressive symptoms such as low mood and fatigue. Demoralization typically lacks the anhedonia associated with depressive disorder due to another medical condition, and individuals will generally find pleasure in previously meaningful activities and be able to experience moments of happiness.</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Depressive Disorder<br>F32.89</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class and do not meet criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. The other specified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive disorder. This is done by recording “other specified depressive disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration depressive episode”).</p>
					<p>Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:
						<ul class="number">
							<li><strong>Recurrent brief depression:</strong> Concurrent presence of depressed mood and at least four other symptoms of depression for 2–13 days at least once per month (not associated with the menstrual cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder and does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder.</li>
							<li><strong>Short-duration depressive episode (4–13 days):</strong> Depressed affect and at least four of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or impairment that persists for more than 4 days, but less than 14 days, in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for recurrent brief depression.</li>
							<li><strong>Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms:</strong> Depressed affect and at least one of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms.</li>
							<li><strong>Major depressive episode superimposed</strong> on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. <strong>Note:</strong> Major depressive episodes that are part of schizoaffective disorder do not merit an additional diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder.</li>

					<h3>Unspecified Depressive Disorder<br>F32.A</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class and do not meet criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. The unspecified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific depressive disorder, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).</p>

					<h3>Specifiers for Depressive Disorders</h3>
					<p>Specify if:
						<ul>
							<li><p><strong>With anxious distress:</strong> Anxious distress is defined as the presence of at least two of the following symptoms during the majority of days of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission) or current persistent depressive disorder:</p>
								<ul class="number">
									<li>Feeling keyed up or tense.</li>
									<li>Feeling unusually restless.</li>
									<li>Difficulty concentrating because of worry.</li>
									<li>Fear that something awful may happen.</li>
									<li>Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself.</li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<p>Specify current severity:
										<ul class="specifier">
											<li><strong>Mild:</strong> Two symptoms.</li>
											<li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Three symptoms.</li>
											<li><strong>Moderate-severe:</strong> Four or five symptoms.</li>
											<li><strong>Severe:</strong> Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p><strong>Note:</strong> Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.</p>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With mixed features:</strong>
								<ul class="upperAlhpa">
									<li>At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission):</li>
									<ul class="number">
										<li>Elevated, expansive mood.</li>
										<li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.</li>
										<li>More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.</li>
										<li>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.</li>
										<li>Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually).</li>
										<li>Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).</li>
										<li>Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia).</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person’s usual behavior.</li>
									<li>For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.</li>
									<li>The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).
										<br><strong>Note:</strong> Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.</li>
								</ul></p>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With melancholic features:</strong>
								<ul class="upperAlhpa">
									<li>One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission):</li>
									<ul class="number">
										<li>Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.</li>
										<li>Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens).</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Three (or more) of the following:</li>
									<ul class="number">
										<li>A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood.</li>
										<li>Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.</li>
										<li>Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).</li>
										<li>Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.</li>
										<li>Significant anorexia or weight loss.</li>
										<li>Excessive or inappropriate guilt.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong>Note:</strong> The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are present at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always present and are observable by others.<br>Melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are more likely to occur in individuals with psychotic features.</p>
								</ul>
								</p>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With atypical features:</strong> This specifier is applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission) or current persistent depressive disorder.
								<ul class="upperAlhpa">
									<li>Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events).</li>
									<li>Two (or more) of the following:</li>
									<ul class="number">
										<li>Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.</li>
										<li>Hypersomnia.</li>
										<li>Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).</li>
										<li>A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the same episode.</li>
								<p><strong>Note:</strong> “Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated, “endogenous” presentations of depression that were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.<br>Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become euthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods.</p>
								</ul>
							</p>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With psychotic features:</strong> Delusions and/or hallucinations are present at any time in the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission). If psychotic features are present, specify if mood-congruent or mood- incongruent:</p>
								<ul class="specifier">
									<li><strong>With mood-congruent psychotic features:</strong> The content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment.</li>
									<li><strong>With mood-incongruent psychotic features:</strong> The content of the delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, o</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<p><strong>With catatonia:</strong> This specifier is applied to the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission) if catatonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental disorder in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders.”</p>

							<li><p><strong>With peripartum onset:</strong> This specifier is applied to the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission) if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery.</p>
								<ul>
									<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum. About 50% of postpartum major depressive episodes begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes.<br>Between conception and birth, about 9% of women will experience a major depressive episode. The best estimate for prevalence of a major depressive episode between birth and 12 months postpartum is just below 7%.<br>Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic features. Infanticide (a rare occurrence) is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.<br>Postpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is particularly increased for women with prior postpartum psychotic mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.<br>Once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period, which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention.<br>Peripartum-onset depressive disorders must be distinguished from the much more common “maternity blues,” or what is known in lay terms as “baby blues.” Maternity blues is not considered to be a mental disorder and is characterized by sudden changes in mood (e.g., the sudden onset of tearfulness in the absence of depression) that do not cause functional impairment and that are likely caused by physiological changes occurring after delivery. It is temporary and self-limited, typically improving quickly (within a week) without the need for treatment. Other symptoms of maternity blues include sleep disturbance and even confusion that can occur shortly after delivery.<br>Perinatal women may be at higher risk for depressive disorders due to thyroid abnormalities as well as other medical conditions that can cause depressive symptoms. If the depressive symptoms are judged to be due to another medical condition related to the perinatal period, depressive disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed instead of a major depressive episode, with peripartum onset.</p>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li><p><strong>With seasonal pattern:</strong> This specifier applies to recurrent major depressive disorder.</p>
								<ul class="upperAlhpa">
									<li>There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall or winter).<br><strong>Note:</strong> Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).</li>
									<li>Full remissions also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring).</li>
									<li>In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate the temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major depressive episodes have occurred during that same period.</li>
									<li>Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially outnumber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime.</li>
									<p><strong>Note:</strong> The specifier “with seasonal pattern” can apply to the pattern of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individual’s lifetime.<br>This specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better explained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or school schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by loss of energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates.<br>The prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of seasonality, with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes.</p>

							<li><strong>In full remission:</strong> During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present.</li>

						<ul class="number">
							<li>Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from home or from major attachment figures.</li>

							<li>Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work, or elsewhere because of fear of separation.</li>
							<li>Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures at home or in other settings.</li>
							<li>Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure.</li>
							<li>Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.</li>
							<li>Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, nausea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is anticipated.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults.</li>
						<li>The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Separation anxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder in that the anxiety in separation anxiety disorder predominantly concerns real or imagined separation from attachment figures. Furthermore, if other worries occur, they are not excessive.</p>
					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>In separation anxiety disorder, threats of separation from close attachments may lead to extreme anxiety and panic attacks. In contrast to panic disorder, where panic attacks occur unexpectedly and are usually accompanied by fears of dying or going “crazy,” the panic attacks in separation anxiety disorder occur in anticipation of real or imagined separations from attachment figures or places of safety and security, or from worries that untoward events will befall the individual’s close attachments.</p>
					<p><strong>Agoraphobia.</strong>
						<br>Unlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation anxiety disorder are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in situations from which escape is perceived as difficult in the event of panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms. Instead, they fear being away from places of safety associated with their major attachment figures.</p>
					<p><strong>Conduct disorder.</strong>
						<br>School avoidance (truancy) is common in conduct disorder, but anxiety about separation is not responsible for school absences, and the child or adolescent usually stays away from, rather than returns to, the home.</p>
					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>School refusal may be attributable to social anxiety disorder. In such instances, the school avoidance is due to fear of being judged negatively by others rather than due to worries about being separated from attachment figures.</p>
					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Fear of separation from loved ones is common after a traumatic event such as a major disaster, particularly when periods of separation from loved ones are experienced during the traumatic event. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the central symptoms concern intrusions about, and avoidance of, memories associated with the traumatic event itself, whereas in separation anxiety disorder, the worries and avoidance concern the well- being of attachment figures and separation from them.</p>
					<p><strong>Illness anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Separation anxiety disorder concerns worries about the health and well-being of close attachments. In contrast, individuals with illness anxiety disorder worry about specific medical illnesses they themselves may have, not about them being separated from their close attachments.</p>
					<p><strong>Prolonged grief disorder.</strong>
						<br>Intense yearning or longing for the deceased, intense sorrow and emotional pain, and preoccupation with the deceased or the circumstances of the death are expected responses occurring in prolonged grief disorder, whereas fear of possible separation from key attachment figures is central in separation anxiety disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive and bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>These disorders may be associated with reluctance to leave home, but the main concern is not worry or fear of untoward events befalling attachment figures, but rather low motivation for engaging with the outside world. However, individuals with separation anxiety disorder may become depressed while being separated or in anticipation of separation.</p>
					<p><strong>Oppositional defiant disorder.</strong>
						<br>Children and adolescents with separation anxiety disorder may be oppositional in the context of being forced to separate from attachment figures. Oppositional defiant disorder should be considered only when there is persistent oppositional behavior unrelated to the anticipation or occurrence of separation from attachment figures.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Unlike the hallucinations in psychotic disorders, the unusual perceptual experiences that may occur in separation anxiety disorder are usually based on a misperception of an actual stimulus, occur only in certain situations (e.g., nighttime), and are reversed by the presence of an attachment figure.</p>
					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Dependent personality disorder is characterized by an indiscriminate tendency to rely on others, whereas separation anxiety disorder involves concern about the proximity and safety of key attachment figures. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by fear of abandonment by loved ones, but problems in identity, self-direction, interpersonal functioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to that disorder, whereas they are not central to separation anxiety disorder.</p>

					<h3>Selective Mutism<br>F94.0</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which there is an expectation for speaking (e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.</li>
						<li>The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication.</li>
						<li>The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of school).</li>
						<li>The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation.</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Silent period in immigrant children learning a second language.</strong>
						<br>Selective mutism must be distinguished from the typical “silent period” associated with the acquisition of a new language in young children. If comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak persists in both languages, in several unfamiliar settings, and for a prolonged period, a diagnosis of selective mutism may be warranted.</p>
					<p><strong>Communication disorders.</strong>
						<br>Selective mutism should be distinguished from speech disturbances that are better explained by a communication disorder, such as language disorder, speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder), childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), or social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Unlike selective mutism, the speech disturbance in these conditions is not restricted to a specific social situation.</p>
					<p><strong>Neurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, or severe intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) may have problems in social communication and be unable to speak appropriately in social situations. In contrast, selective mutism should be diagnosed only when a child has an established capacity to speak in some social situations (e.g., typically at home).</p>
					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>The social anxiety and social avoidance in social anxiety disorder may be associated with selective mutism. In such cases, both diagnoses may be given.</p>

						<li>The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.</li>
						<li>The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.</li>
						<li>The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context.</li>
						<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.</li>
						<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situations related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder).</li>

						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>F40.218 Animal</strong> (e.g., spiders, insects, dogs).</li>
							<li><strong>F40.228 Natural environment</strong> (e.g., heights, storms, water).</li>
							<li><strong>F40.23x Blood-injection-injury</strong> (e.g., needles, invasive medical procedures).</li>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> When more than one phobic stimulus is present, code all ICD-10-CM codes that apply (e.g., for fear of snakes and flying, F40.218 specific phobia, animal, and F40.248 specific phobia, situational).</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Agoraphobia.</strong>
						<br>Situational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical presentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e.g., flying, enclosed places, elevators). If an individual fears only one of the agoraphobic situations, then specific phobia, situational, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis of agoraphobia is likely warranted. For example, an individual who fears airplanes and elevators (which overlap with the “public transportation” agoraphobic situation) but does not fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situational, whereas an individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap with two agoraphobic situations, “using public transportation” and “standing in line or being in a crowd”) would be diagnosed with agoraphobia. Criterion B of agoraphobia (the situations are feared or avoided “because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms”) can also be useful in differentiating agoraphobia from specific phobia. If the situations are feared for reasons other than not being able to escape or get help, such as fear of being harmed directly by the object or situation (e.g., fear of the plane crashing, fear of the animal biting), a specific phobia diagnosis may be more appropriate.</p>
					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>If the situations are feared because of negative evaluation, social anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia.</p>
					<p><strong>Separation anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>If the situations are feared because of separation from a primary caregiver or attachment figure, separation anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia.</p>
					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with specific phobia may experience panic attacks when confronted with their feared situation or object. A diagnosis of specific phobia would be given if the panic attacks only occurred in response to the specific object or situation, whereas a diagnosis of panic disorder would be given if the individual also experienced panic attacks that were unexpected (i.e., not in response to the specific phobia object or situation).</p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>If an individual’s primary fear or anxiety is of an object or situation as a result of obsessions (e.g., fear of blood due to obsessive thoughts about contamination from blood-borne pathogens [i.e., HIV]; fear of driving due to obsessive images of harming others), and if other diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder are met, then obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed.</p>
					<p><strong>Trauma- and stressor-related disorders.</strong>
						<br>If the phobia develops following a traumatic event, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be considered as a diagnosis. However, traumatic events can precede the onset of PTSD and specific phobia. In this case, a diagnosis of specific phobia would be assigned only if all of the criteria for PTSD are not met.</p>
					<p><strong>Eating disorders.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance behavior is exclusively limited to avoidance of food and food-related cues, in which case a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa should be considered.</p>
					<p><strong>Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>When the fear and avoidance are attributable to delusional thinking (as in schizophrenia or other schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders), a diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted.</p>

				<div id="Ch5_4" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Social Anxiety Disorder<br>F40.10</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech).<br><strong>Note:</strong> In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults.</li>
						<li>The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others).</li>
						<li>The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.<br><strong>Note:</strong> In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations.</li>
						<li>The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.</li>
						<li>The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.</li>
						<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.</li>
						<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.</li>
						<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.</li>
						<li>If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>Performance only:</strong> If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normative shyness.</strong>
						<br>Shyness (i.e., social reticence) is a common personality trait and is not by itself pathological. In some societies, shyness is even evaluated positively. However, when there is a significant adverse impact on social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should be considered, and when full diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder are met, the disorder should be diagnosed. Only a minority (12%) of self- identified shy individuals in the United States have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Agoraphobia.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with agoraphobia may fear and avoid social situations (e.g., going to a movie) because escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of incapacitation or panic-like symptoms, whereas individuals with social anxiety disorder are most fearful of scrutiny by others. Moreover, individuals with social anxiety disorder are likely to be calm when left entirely alone, which is often not the case in agoraphobia.</p>
					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with social anxiety disorder may have panic attacks, but the panic attacks are always cued by social situations and do not occur “out of the blue.” Additionally, individuals with social anxiety disorder are more likely to be distressed by fear of negative evaluation stemming from a panic attack than by the panic attacks themselves.</p>
					<p><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Social worries are common in generalized anxiety disorder, but the focus is more on the nature of ongoing relationships rather than on fear of negative evaluation. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, particularly children, may have excessive worries about the quality of their social performance, but these worries also pertain to nonsocial performance and when the individual is not being evaluated by others. In social anxiety disorder, the worries focus on social performance and others’ evaluation.</p>
					<p><strong>Separation anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with separation anxiety disorder may avoid social settings (including school refusal) because of concerns about being separated from attachment figures or, in children, about requiring the presence of a parent when it is not developmentally appropriate. Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are usually comfortable in social settings when their attachment figure is present or when they are at home, whereas those with social anxiety disorder may be uncomfortable when social situations occur at home or in the presence of attachment figures.</p>
					<p><strong>Specific phobias.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with specific phobias may fear embarrassment or humiliation (e.g., embarrassment about fainting when they have their blood drawn), but they do not generally fear negative evaluation in other social situations.</p>
					<p><strong>Selective mutism.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with selective mutism may fail to speak because of fear of negative evaluation, but they do not fear negative evaluation in social situations where no speaking is required (e.g., nonverbal play).</p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with major depressive disorder may be concerned about being negatively evaluated by others because they feel they are bad or not worthy of being liked. In contrast, individuals with social anxiety disorder are worried about being negatively evaluated because of certain social behaviors or physical symptoms.</p>
					<p><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others; this preoccupation often causes social anxiety and avoidance. If their social fears and avoidance are caused only by their beliefs about their appearance, a separate diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is not warranted.</p>
					<p><strong>Delusional disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with delusional disorder may have nonbizarre delusions and/or hallucinations related to the delusional theme that focus on being rejected by or offending others. Although extent of insight into beliefs about social situations may vary, many individuals with social anxiety disorder have good insight that their beliefs are out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation.</p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Social anxiety and social communication deficits are hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder typically have adequate age- appropriate social relationships and social communication capacity, although they may appear to have impairment in these areas when first interacting with unfamiliar peers or adults.</p>
					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Given its frequent onset in childhood and its persistence into and through adulthood, social anxiety disorder may resemble a personality disorder. The most apparent overlap is with avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder have a broader avoidance pattern and higher rates of impairment than those individuals with social anxiety disorder. Moreover, individuals with avoidant personality disorder have a strong and pervasively negative self-concept, a view of rejection as equating to a global evaluation of the self as being of little worth, and a sense of not fitting in socially that dates from early childhood. Nonetheless, social anxiety disorder is typically more comorbid with avoidant personality disorder than with any other personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder is more comorbid with social anxiety disorder than with any other anxiety disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Social fears and discomfort can occur as part of schizophrenia, but other evidence for psychotic symptoms is usually present. In individuals with an eating disorder, it is important to determine that fear of negative evaluation about eating disorder symptoms or behaviors (e.g., purging and vomiting) is not the sole source of social anxiety before applying a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Similarly, obsessive-compulsive disorder may be associated with social anxiety, but the additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is used only when social fears and avoidance are independent of the foci of the obsessions and compulsions.</p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Medical conditions may produce symptoms that may be embarrassing (e.g., trembling in Parkinson’s disease). When the fear of negative evaluation due to other medical conditions is judged to be excessive, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should be considered.</p>
					<p><strong>Oppositional defiant disorder.</strong>
						<br>Refusal to speak because of opposition to authority figures should be differentiated from failure to speak because of fear of negative evaluation.</p>

					<h3>Panic Disorder<br>F41.0</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Recurrent unexpected panic attacks.

						<ul class="number">
							<li>Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, “going crazy”).</li>
							<li>A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders).</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic attacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety disorder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia; in response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in response to reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Only limited-symptom panic attacks.</strong>
						<br>Panic disorder should not be diagnosed if full-symptom (unexpected) panic attacks have never been experienced. In the case of only limited-symptom unexpected panic attacks, an other specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis should be considered.</p>
					<p><strong>Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Panic disorder is not diagnosed if the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition. Examples of medical conditions that can cause panic attacks include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure disorders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the etiological role of another medical condition. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Panic disorder is not diagnosed if the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance. Intoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamine-type substances, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack.<br>However, if panic attacks continue to occur outside of the context of substance use (e.g., long after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal have ended), a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered. In addition, because panic disorder may precede substance use in some individuals and may be associated with increased substance use, especially for purposes of self- medication, a detailed history should be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to excessive substance use. If this is the case, a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered in addition to a diagnosis of substance use disorder. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.</p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature (e.g., other anxiety disorders and psychotic disorders).</strong>
						<br>Panic attacks that occur as a symptom of other anxiety disorders are expected (e.g., triggered by social situations in social anxiety disorder, by phobic objects or situations in specific phobia or agoraphobia, by worry in generalized anxiety disorder, by separation from home or attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder) and thus would not meet criteria for panic disorder. (Note: Sometimes an unexpected panic attack is associated with the onset of another anxiety disorder, but then the attacks become expected, whereas panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.) If the panic attacks occur only in response to specific triggers, then only the relevant anxiety disorder is assigned. However, if the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks as well and shows persistent concern and worry or behavioral change because of the attacks, then an additional diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered.</p>

					</ul>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an individual’s presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned.</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Specific phobia, situational type.</strong>
						<br>Differentiating agoraphobia from situational specific phobia can be challenging in some cases, because these conditions share several symptom characteristics and criteria. Specific phobia, situational type, should be diagnosed versus agoraphobia if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations. Requiring fears from two or more of the agoraphobic situations is a robust means for differentiating agoraphobia from specific phobias, particularly the situational subtype. Additional differentiating features include the content of the individual’s cognitions. Thus, if the situation is feared for reasons other than panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fears of being directly harmed by the situation itself, such as fear of the plane crashing for individuals who fear flying), then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be more appropriate.</p>
					<p><strong>Separation anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Separation anxiety disorder can be best differentiated from agoraphobia by examining the individual’s cognitions. In separation anxiety disorder, the thoughts are about detachment from significant others and the home environment (i.e., parents or other attachment figures), whereas in agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms in the feared situations.</p>
					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Agoraphobia should be differentiated from social anxiety disorder based primarily on the situational clusters that trigger fear, anxiety, or avoidance and the individual’s cognitions. In social anxiety disorder, the focus is on fear of being negatively evaluated.</p>
					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>When criteria for panic disorder are met, agoraphobia should not be diagnosed if the avoidance behaviors associated with the panic attacks do not extend to avoidance of two or more agoraphobic situations.</p>
					<p><strong>Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examining whether the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is related only to situations that remind the individual of a traumatic event. If the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is restricted to trauma reminders, and if the avoidance behavior does not extend to two or more agoraphobic situations, then a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not warranted.</p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>In major depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leaving home because of apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhedonia. If the avoidance is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms, then agoraphobia should not be diagnosed.</p>
					<p><strong>Avoidance related to other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with certain medical conditions may avoid situations because of realistic concerns about being incapacitated (e.g., fainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks) or being embarrassed (e.g., diarrhea in an individual with Crohn’s disease). The diagnosis of agoraphobia should be given only when the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that usually associated with these medical conditions.</p>

					<h3>Generalized Anxiety Disorder<br>F41.1</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).</li>
						<li>The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.</li>
						<li>The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months):<br><strong>Note:</strong> Only one item is required in children.</li>
						<ul class="number">

							<li>Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder, contamination or other obsessions in obsessive- compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be assigned if the individual’s anxiety and worry are judged, based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination, to be a physiological effect of another specific medical condition (e.g., pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism).</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder by the fact that a substance or medication (e.g., a drug of abuse, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the anxiety. For example, severe anxiety that occurs only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxiety disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with social anxiety disorder often have anticipatory anxiety that is focused on upcoming social situations in which they must perform or be evaluated by others, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry, whether or not they are being evaluated.</p>
					<p><strong>Separation anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with separation anxiety disorder worry excessively only about separation from attachment figures, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may worry about separation but present other excessive worry concerns as well.</p>
					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Panic attacks that are triggered by worry in generalized anxiety disorder would not qualify for panic disorder. However, if the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks as well and shows persistent concern and worry or behavioral change because of the attacks, then an additional diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered.</p>
					<p><strong>Illness anxiety disorder and somatic symptom disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry about multiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve their health. If the individual’s only fear is his or her own illness, then illness anxiety disorder should be diagnosed. Worry focusing on somatic symptoms is characteristic for somatic symptom disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Several features distinguish the excessive worry of generalized anxiety disorder from the obsessional thoughts of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In generalized anxiety disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming problems, and it is the excessiveness of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas that take the form of intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images.</p>
					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorders.</strong>
						<br>Anxiety is invariably present in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the anxiety and worry are better explained by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Although anxiety may manifest in adjustment disorder, this residual category should be used only when the criteria are not met for any other mental disorder (including generalized anxiety disorder). Moreover, in adjustment disorders, the anxiety occurs in response to an identifiable stressor within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and does not persist for more than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences.</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Although generalized anxiety/worry is a common associated feature of depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder may be diagnosed comorbidly if the anxiety/worry is sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced anxiety disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance- induced anxiety disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced anxiety disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced anxiety disorder.

					<p>Specify (see Table 1 in the chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders," which indicates whether "with onset during intoxication" and/or "with onset during withdrawal" applies to a given substance class; or specify "with onset after medication use"):
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>With onset during intoxication:</strong> If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.</li>
							<li><strong>With onset during withdrawal:</strong> If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.</li>
							<li><strong>With onset after medication use:</strong> If symptoms developed at initiation of medication, with a change in use of medication, or during withdrawal of medication.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal.</strong>
						<br>Anxiety symptoms commonly occur in substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder either with onset during intoxication or with onset during withdrawal should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the panic or anxiety symptoms are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal.</p>
					<p><strong>Independent anxiety disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance/medication).</strong>
						<br>An independent anxiety disorder co-occurring with substance/medication use is distinguished from a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder by the fact that even though a substance/medication may be taken in high enough amounts to be possibly etiologically related to the anxiety symptoms, the anxiety symptoms are observed at times other than during substance/medication use (i.e., preceding the onset of substance/medication use or persisting for a substantial period of time after substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, or medication use) and would warrant the diagnosis of an independent anxiety disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Delirium.</strong>
						<br>If panic or anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of delirium, they are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately.</p>
					<p><strong>Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>If the panic or anxiety symptoms are attributed to the physiological consequences of another medical condition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for the medical condition), anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether the medication is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety symptoms are attributable to a substance/medication or to another medical condition or are primary (i.e., not attributable to either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder would be indicated.</p>

					<h3>Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition<br>F06.4</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.</li>
						<li>There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.</li>
						<li>The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.</li>
						<li>The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> Include the name of the other medical condition within the name of the mental disorder (e.g., F06.4 anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the anxiety disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., D35.00 pheochromocytoma; F06.4 anxiety disorder due to pheochromocytoma).</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Delirium and major or mild neurocognitive disorder.</strong>
						<br>A separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major or mild neurocognitive disorder if the anxiety is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder and if anxiety is a prominent part of the clinical presentation.</p>
					<p><strong>Mixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and anxiety).</strong>
						<br>If the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should be considered. Certain medications are known to increase anxiety (e.g., corticosteroids, estrogens, metoclopramide), and when this is the case, the medication may be the most likely etiology, although it may be difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is attributable to the medications or to the medical illness itself. When a diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety is being made in relation to recreational or nonprescribed drugs, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that develop during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance/medication- induced anxiety disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance used. If the disturbance is associated with both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication- induced anxiety disorder) can be given. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms.</p>
					<p><strong>Anxiety disorder (not due to a known medical condition).</strong>
						<br>Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from other anxiety disorders (especially panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder). In other anxiety disorders, no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with another medical condition can be demonstrated. Late age at onset, atypical symptoms, and the absence of a personal or family history of anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Anxiety disorders can exacerbate or pose increased risk for medical conditions such as cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction and should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another medical condition in these cases.</p>
					<p><strong>Illness anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by worry about illness, concern about pain, and bodily preoccupations. In the case of illness anxiety disorder, individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Although an individual with illness anxiety disorder and a diagnosed medical condition is likely to experience anxiety about the medical condition, the medical condition is not physiologically related to the anxiety symptoms.</p>
					<p><strong>Adjustment disorders.</strong>
						<br>Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from adjustment disorders with anxiety or adjustment disorders with anxiety and depressed mood. Adjustment disorder is warranted when individuals experience a maladaptive response to the stress of being diagnosed with or having to manage the medical condition. The reaction to stress usually concerns the meaning or consequences of the medical condition, in contrast with the experience of anxiety or mood symptoms that occur as a physiological consequence of the medical condition. In adjustment disorder, the anxiety symptoms are typically related to coping with the stress of having the medical condition, whereas in anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, individuals are more likely to have prominent physical symptoms and to be focused on issues other than the stress of the illness itself.</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Anxiety Disorder<br>F41.8</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the anxiety disorders diagnostic class, and do not meet criteria for adjustment disorder with anxiety or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. The other specified anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific anxiety disorder. This is done by recording “other specified anxiety disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “generalized anxiety occurring less often than ‘more days than not’ ”).</p>

					<p>特別註明：
						<ul class="specifier">

						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Anxiety disorders.</strong>
						<br>Recurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for reassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders. However, the recurrent thoughts that are present in generalized anxiety disorder (i.e., worries) are usually about real-life concerns, whereas the obsessions of OCD usually do not involve real-life concerns and can include content that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions are usually present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, individuals with specific phobia can have a fear reaction to specific objects or situations; however, in specific phobia the feared object is usually much more circumscribed, and rituals are not present. In social anxiety disorder, the feared objects or situations are limited to social interactions or performance situations, and avoidance or reassurance seeking is focused on reducing feelings of embarrassment.</p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>OCD needs to be distinguished from the rumination of major depressive disorder, in which thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily experienced as intrusive or distressing; moreover, ruminations are not linked to compulsions, as is typical in OCD.</p>
					<p><strong>Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>In body dysmorphic disorder, the obsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance; and in trichotillomania (hair- pulling disorder), the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling in the absence of obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked distress associated with discarding items, and excessive accumulation of objects. However, if an individual has obsessions that are typical of OCD (e.g., concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these obsessions lead to compulsive accumulation (e.g., acquiring all objects in a set to attain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers because they may contain information that could prevent harm), a diagnosis of OCD should be given instead.</p>
					<p><strong>Eating disorders.</strong>
						<br>OCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the obsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and food.</p>
					<p><strong>Tics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements.</strong>
						<br>A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye blinking, throat clearing). A stereotyped movement is a repetitive, seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g., head banging, body rocking, self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically less complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However, distinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be difficult. Whereas compulsions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics are often preceded by premonitory sensory urges. Some individuals have symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case both diagnoses may be warranted.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional OCD beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing their condition from delusional disorder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or disorganized speech). For individuals whose OCD symptoms warrant the “with absent insight/delusional beliefs” specifier, these symptoms should not be diagnosed as a psychotic disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Other compulsive-like behaviors.</strong>
						<br>Certain behaviors are sometimes described as “compulsive,” including sexual behavior (in the case of paraphilias), gambling (i.e., gambling disorder), and substance use (e.g., alcohol use disorder). However, these behaviors differ from the compulsions of OCD in that the person usually derives pleasure from the activity and may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences.</p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Although obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and OCD have similar names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders are quite different. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by intrusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to these intrusive symptoms; instead, it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive pattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms of both OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses can be given.</p>

						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normal appearance concerns and clearly noticeable physical defects.</strong>
						<br>Body dysmorphic disorder differs from normal appearance concerns in being characterized by excessive appearance-related preoccupations and repetitive behaviors that are time-consuming, are usually difficult to resist or control, and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Physical defects that are clearly noticeable (i.e., not slight) are not diagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder. However, skin picking as a symptom of body dysmorphic disorder can cause noticeable skin lesions and scarring; in such cases, body dysmorphic disorder should be diagnosed.</p>
					<p><strong>Eating disorders.</strong>
						<br>In an individual with an eating disorder, concerns about being fat or overweight are considered a symptom of the eating disorder rather than body dysmorphic disorder. However, weight concerns may occur in body dysmorphic disorder. Eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder can be comorbid, in which case both should be diagnosed.</p>
					<p><strong>Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>The preoccupations and repetitive behaviors of body dysmorphic disorder differ from obsessions and compulsions in OCD in that the former focus only on physical appearance. These disorders have other differences, such as poorer insight, more frequent depression, and higher rates of suicidal ideation in body dysmorphic disorder. When skin picking is intended to improve the appearance of perceived skin defects, body dysmorphic disorder, rather than excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, is diagnosed. When hair removal (plucking, pulling, or other types of removal) is intended to improve perceived defects in the appearance of facial, head, or body hair, body dysmorphic disorder is diagnosed rather than trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder).</p>
					<p><strong>Illness anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are not preoccupied with having or acquiring a serious illness and in clinical samples do not have particularly elevated levels of somatization.</p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>The prominent preoccupation with appearance and excessive repetitive behaviors in body dysmorphic disorder differentiate it from major depressive disorder. However, major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms are common in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder, often appearing to be secondary to the distress and impairment that body dysmorphic disorder causes. Body dysmorphic disorder should be diagnosed in depressed individuals if diagnostic criteria for body dysmorphic disorder are met.</p>
					<p><strong>Anxiety disorders.</strong>
						<br>Social anxiety and avoidance are common in body dysmorphic disorder. However, unlike social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and avoidant personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder includes prominent appearance-related preoccupation, which may be delusional, and repetitive behaviors. In addition, the social anxiety and avoidance that are characteristic of body dysmorphic disorder are attributable to concerns about perceived appearance defects and the belief or fear that other people will consider these individuals ugly, ridicule them, or reject them because of their physical features. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety and worry in body dysmorphic disorder focus on perceived appearance flaws.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Many individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have delusional appearance beliefs (i.e., complete conviction that their view of their perceived defects is accurate), which is diagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs, not as delusional disorder. Appearance-related ideas or delusions of reference are common in body dysmorphic disorder (i.e., thinking that other people take special notice in a negative way because of the individual’s appearance). However, unlike schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, body dysmorphic disorder involves prominent appearance preoccupations and related repetitive behaviors; disorganized behavior and other psychotic symptoms are absent (except for appearance beliefs, which may be delusional). For individuals whose obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms warrant the “with absent insight/delusional beliefs” specifier, these symptoms should not be diagnosed as a psychotic disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Other disorders and symptoms.</strong>
						<br>Body dysmorphic disorder should not be diagnosed if the preoccupation is limited to discomfort with or a desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics in an individual with gender dysphoria. Nor should body dysmorphic disorder be diagnosed if the preoccupation focuses on the belief that one emits a foul or offensive body odor as in olfactory reference disorder (olfactory reference syndrome), which is an example of an other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder in DSM-5. Body integrity dysphoria (which is included in ICD-11 but not DSM-5) involves a persistent desire to become an amputee in order to correct a mismatch between the individual’s sense of how his or her body should be configured and his or her actual anatomical configuration. In contrast to body dysmorphic disorder, the individual does not feel that the limb to be amputated is ugly or defective in any way, just that it should not be there. Koro, a culturally related disorder that usually occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, consists of a fear that the penis (labia, nipples, or breasts in females) is shrinking or retracting and will disappear into the abdomen, often accompanied by a belief that death will result. Koro differs from body dysmorphic disorder in several ways, including a focus on death rather than preoccupation with perceived ugliness. Dysmorphic concern (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) is a broader construct that is similar to, but not equivalent to, body dysmorphic disorder. It involves symptoms reflecting an overconcern with slight or imagined flaws in appearance.</p>

					<h3>Hoarding Disorder<br>F42.3</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value.</li>
						<li>This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them.</li>
						<li>The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use. If living areas are uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities).</li>
						<li>The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe environment for self and others).</li>
						<li>The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syndrome).</li>
						<li>The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, decreased energy in major depressive disorder, delusions in schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits in major neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism spectrum disorder).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>With excessive acquisition:</strong> If difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by excessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no available space.</li>
						</ul></p>

						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>With good or fair insight:</strong> The individual recognizes that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive acquisition) are problematic.</li>

						</ul></p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of another medical condition (Criterion E), such as traumatic brain injury, surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or seizure control, cerebrovascular disease, infections of the central nervous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis), or neurogenetic conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome. Damage to the anterior ventromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices has been particularly associated with the excessive accumulation of objects. In these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present prior to the onset of the brain damage and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs. Some of these individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and are able to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them, whereas others appear to be very reluctant to discard anything.</p>
					<p><strong>Neurodevelopmental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorder or intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).</p>
					<p><strong>Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of delusions or negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.</p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive episode.</strong>
						<br>Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of energy during a major depressive episode.</p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears of contamination, harm, or feelings of incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Feelings of incompleteness (e.g., losing one’s identity, or having to document and preserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD symptoms associated with this form of hoarding. The accumulation of objects can also be the result of persistently avoiding onerous rituals (e.g., not discarding objects in order to avoid endless washing or checking rituals).<br>In OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual experiences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if excessive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to buy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid contaminating other people), not because of a genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of OCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, fingernail and toenail cuttings, hair, used diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of such items is very unusual in hoarding disorder.<br>When severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of OCD but is judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and OCD may be diagnosed.</p>
					<p><strong>Neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as neurocognitive disorder associated with frontotemporal degeneration or Alzheimer’s disease. Typically, onset of the accumulating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neurocognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior may be accompanied by self-neglect and severe domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibition, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors.</p>

					<h3>Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)<br>F63.3</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Recurrent pulling out of one’s hair, resulting in hair loss.</li>
						<li>Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.</li>
						<li>The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition).</li>
						<li>The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder).</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Normative hair removal/manipulation.</strong>
						<br>Trichotillomania should not be diagnosed when hair removal is performed solely for cosmetic reasons (i.e., to improve physical appearance). Many individuals twist and play with their hair, but this behavior does not usually qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Some individuals may bite rather than pull hair; again, this does not qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania.</p>
					<p><strong>Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with OCD and symmetry concerns may pull out hairs as part of their symmetry rituals, and individuals with body dysmorphic disorder may remove body hair that they perceive as ugly, asymmetrical, or abnormal; in such cases a diagnosis of trichotillomania is not given.</p>
					<p><strong>Stereotypic movement disorder.</strong>
						<br>Stereotypic movement disorder can sometimes involve hair- pulling behavior. For example, a child with intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) or autism spectrum disorder may engage in stereotypic head banging, hand or arm biting, and hair pulling when frustrated or angry, and sometimes when excited. This behavior, if impairing, would be diagnosed as stereotypic movement disorder (co-occurring with intellectual developmental disorder or autism spectrum disorder) rather than trichotillomania.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with a psychotic disorder may remove hair in response to a delusion or hallucination. Trichotillomania is not diagnosed in such cases.</p>
					<p><strong>Another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Trichotillomania is not diagnosed if the hair pulling or hair loss is attributable to another medical condition (e.g., inflammation of the skin or other dermatological conditions). Other causes of noncicatricial (nonscarring) alopecia (e.g., alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium) or cicatricial (scarring) (e.g., chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade, folliculitis decalvans, dissecting folliculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae) should be considered in individuals with hair loss who deny hair pulling. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy can be used to differentiate individuals with trichotillomania from those with dermatological disorders.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance-related disorders.</strong>
						<br>Hair-pulling symptoms may be exacerbated by certain substances— for example, stimulants—but it is less likely that substances are the primary cause of persistent hair pulling.</p>

					<h3>Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder<br>F42.4</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions.</li>
						<li>Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking.</li>
						<li>The skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The skin picking is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g., scabies).</li>
						<li>The skin picking is not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., delusions or tactile hallucinations in a psychotic disorder, attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder, stereotypies in stereotypic movement disorder, or intention to harm oneself in nonsuicidal self-injury).</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Skin picking may occur in response to a delusion (i.e., parasitosis) or tactile hallucination (i.e., formication) in a psychotic disorder. In such cases, excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed.</p>

					<p><strong>Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>Excessive washing compulsions in response to contamination obsessions in individuals with OCD may lead to skin lesions, and skin picking may occur in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder who pick their skin because of appearance concerns; in such cases, excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed. The description of other body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other specified obsessive- compulsive and related disorder excludes individuals whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Neurodevelopmental disorders.</strong>
						<br>While stereotypic movement disorder may be characterized by repetitive self-injurious behavior, onset is in the early developmental period. For example, individuals with the neurogenetic condition Prader-Willi syndrome may have early onset of skin picking, and their symptoms may meet criteria for stereotypic movement disorder. While tics in individuals with Tourette’s disorder may lead to self-injury, the behavior is not tic-like in excoriation disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Dermatitis artefacta.</strong>
						<br>Dermatitis artefacta (also referred to as “factitious dermatitis”) is a term used in dermatology to refer to medically unexplained, presumably self-induced skin lesions that the individual denies any role in creating. Cases in which there is evidence of deception on the individual’s part concerning the skin lesions can be diagnosed as either malingering (if the skin picking is motivated by external incentives) or factitious disorder (if the skin picking occurs in the absence of obvious external rewards). In the absence of deception, excoriation disorder can be diagnosed if there are repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking.</p>

					<p><strong>Other disorders.</strong>
						<br>Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily attributable to the intention to harm oneself that is characteristic of nonsuicidal self-injury.</p>

					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily attributable to another medical condition. For example, scabies is a dermatological condition invariably associated with severe itching and scratching. However, excoriation disorder may be precipitated or exacerbated by an underlying dermatological condition. For example, acne may lead to some scratching and picking, which may also be associated with comorbid excoriation disorder (so-called acne excoriée). The differentiation between these two clinical situations (acne with some scratching and picking vs. acne with comorbid excoriation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent to which the individual’s skin picking has become independent of the underlying dermatological condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced disorders.</strong>
						<br>Skin-picking symptoms may also be induced by certain substances (e.g., cocaine), in which case excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed. If such skin picking is clinically significant, then a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered.</p>

							<p>The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non- substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).</p>
						</ul>
						<li>The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.</li>

					<p><strong>Note:</strong> This diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive- compulsive and related disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.</p>

							<li><strong>With onset during intoxication:</strong> If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.</li>
							<li><strong>With onset during withdrawal:</strong> If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.</li>
							<li><strong>With onset after medication use:</strong> If symptoms developed at initiation of medication, with a change in use of medication, or during withdrawal of medication.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal.</strong>
						<br>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms may occur in the context of substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder either with onset during intoxication or with onset during withdrawal should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal if the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms are judged to be in excess of those usually associated with intoxication or withdrawal and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance).</strong>
						<br>Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is distinguished from a primary obsessive- compulsive and related disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors with respect to substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings for use or intoxication. Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder arises only in association with intoxication, whereas a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The presence of features that are atypical of a primary obsessive- compulsive and related disorder, such as atypical age at onset of symptoms, may suggest a substance-induced etiology. A primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder diagnosis is warranted if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance intoxication or the individual has a history of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>If the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are attributable to another medical condition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for the other medical condition), obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether the medication is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., obsessive- compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication- induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the symptoms are attributable to a substance/medication or to another medical condition or are primary (i.e., attributable to neither a substance/medication nor another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or</p> unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder would be indicated.

					<p><strong>Delirium.</strong>

							<li><strong>With skin-picking symptoms:</strong> If skin picking predominates in the clinical presentation.</li>
						</ul></p>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., F06.8 obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction). The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., I69.398 cerebral infarction; F06.8 obsessive- compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction).</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Delirium.</strong>
						<br>A separate diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the dementia and if obsessive- compulsive symptoms are a prominent part of the clinical presentation.</p>

					<p><strong>Mixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms) judged to be due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>If the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered. When a substance/medication-induced obsessive- compulsive and related disorder is being diagnosed in relation to drugs of abuse, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance/medication-induced obsessive- compulsive and related disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance used.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (primary).</strong>
						<br>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. In primary mental disorders, no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be demonstrated. Acute-onset symptoms, late age at onset, or atypical symptoms suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Illness anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. In the case of illness anxiety disorder, individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions.</p>

					<p><strong>Associated feature of another mental disorder.</strong>
						<br>Obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms may be an associated feature of another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa).</p>

					<p><strong>Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder or unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.</strong>
						<br>These diagnoses are given if it is unclear whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or due to another medical condition.</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder<br>F42.8</h3>

The other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording “other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “obsessional jealousy”).</p>
					<p>Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:</p>
					<ul class="number">
						<li><strong>Body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws:</strong> This is similar to body dysmorphic disorder except that the defects or flaws in physical appearance are clearly observable by others (i.e., they are more noticeable than “slight”). In such cases, the preoccupation with these flaws is clearly excessive and causes significant impairment or distress.</li>
						<li><strong>Body dysmorphic–like disorder without repetitive behaviors:</strong> Presentations that meet body dysmorphic disorder except that the individual has never performed repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the appearance concerns.</li>
						<li><strong>Other body-focused repetitive behavior disorder:</strong> Presentations involving recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors other than hair pulling and skin picking (e.g., nail biting, lip biting, cheek chewing) that are accompanied by repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors and that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li><strong>Obsessional jealousy:</strong> This is characterized by nondelusional preoccupation with a partner’s perceived infidelity. The preoccupations may lead to repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the infidelity concerns; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning; and they are not better explained by another mental disorder such as delusional disorder, jealous type, or paranoid personality disorder.</li>
						<li><strong>Olfactory reference disorder (olfactory reference syndrome):</strong> This is characterized by the individual’s persistent preoccupation with the belief that he or she emits a foul or offensive body odor that is unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others; in response to this preoccupation, these individuals often engage in repetitive and excessive behaviors such as repeatedly checking for body odor, excessive showering, or seeking reassurance, as well as excessive attempts to camouflage the perceived odor. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. In traditional Japanese psychiatry, this disorder is known as jikoshu-kyofu, a variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Culture and Psychiatric Diagnosis” in Section III).</li>
						<li><strong>Shubo-kyofu:</strong> A variant of taijin kyofusho (see “Culture and Psychiatric Diagnosis” in Section III) that is similar to body dysmorphic disorder and is characterized by excessive fear of having a bodily deformity.</li>
						<li><strong>Koro:</strong> Related to dhat syndrome (see “Culture and Psychiatric Diagnosis” in Section III), an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis in males (or the vulva and nipples in females) will recede into the body, possibly leading to death.</li>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Aberrant social behaviors manifest in young children with reactive attachment disorder, but they also are key features of autism spectrum disorder. Specifically, young children with either condition can manifest dampened expression of positive emotions, cognitive and language delays, and impairments in social reciprocity. As a result, reactive attachment disorder must be differentiated from autism spectrum disorder. These two disorders can be distinguished based on differential histories of neglect and on the presence of restricted interests or ritualized behaviors, specific deficit in social communication, and selective attachment behaviors. Children with reactive attachment disorder have experienced a history of severe social neglect, although it is not always possible to obtain detailed histories about the precise nature of their experiences, especially in initial evaluations. Children with autism spectrum disorder will only rarely have a history of social neglect. The restricted interests and repetitive behaviors characteristic of autism spectrum disorder are not a feature of reactive attachment disorder. These clinical features manifest as excessive adherence to rituals and routines; restricted, fixated interests; and unusual sensory reactions. However, it is important to note that children with either condition can exhibit stereotypic behaviors such as rocking or flapping. Children with either disorder also may exhibit a range of intellectual functioning, but only children with autism spectrum disorder exhibit selective impairments in social communicative behaviors, such as intentional communication (i.e., impairment in communication that is deliberate, goal-directed, and aimed at influencing the behavior of the recipient). Children with reactive attachment disorder show social communicative functioning comparable to their overall level of intellectual functioning. Finally, children with autism spectrum disorder regularly show attachment behavior typical for their developmental level. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder do so only rarely or inconsistently, if at all. Structured observations can help discriminate between the two disorders.</p>
					<p><strong>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).</strong>
						<br>Developmental delays often accompany reactive attachment disorder, but they should not be confused with the disorder. Children with intellectual developmental disorder should exhibit social and emotional skills comparable to their cognitive skills and do not demonstrate the profound reduction in positive affect and emotion regulation difficulties evident in children with reactive attachment disorder. In addition, developmentally delayed children who have reached a cognitive age of 7–9 months should demonstrate selective attachments regardless of their chronological age. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder show lack of preferred attachment despite having attained a developmental age of at least 9 months.</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Depression in young children is also associated with reductions in positive affect. There is limited evidence, however, to suggest that children with depressive disorders have impairments in attachment. That is, young children who have been diagnosed with depressive disorders still should seek and respond to comforting efforts by caregivers.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Adjustment disorders.</strong>
						<br>In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity or type rather than a stressor involving exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence as required by PTSD Criterion A. The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is used when the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet all other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is also diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet PTSD Criterion A (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired).</p>

					<p><strong>Other posttraumatic disorders and conditions.</strong>
						<br>Not all psychopathology that occurs in individuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The PTSD diagnosis requires that trauma exposure precede the onset or exacerbation of pertinent symptoms. If the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets criteria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addition to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if they are better explained by PTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic disorder that occur only after exposure to traumatic reminders). If severe, symptom response patterns to the extreme stressor that meet criteria for another mental disorder may warrant a separate diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia) in addition to PTSD.</p>

					<p><strong>Acute stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month following exposure to the traumatic event.</p>

					<p><strong>Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>In OCD, there are recurrent intrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of PTSD or acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the arousal and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance, irritability, and anxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a specific traumatic event. The symptoms of separation anxiety disorder are clearly related to separation from home or family, rather than to a traumatic event.</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Major depression may or may not be preceded by a traumatic event and should be diagnosed if full criteria have been met. Specifically, major depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it include a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E. However, if full criteria for PTSD are also met, both diagnoses may be given.</p>

					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Both ADHD and PTSD may include problems in attention, concentration, and learning. In contrast to ADHD, where the problems in attention, concentration, and learning must have their onset prior to age 12, in PTSD the symptoms have their onset following exposure to a Criterion A traumatic event. In PTSD, disruptions in the individual’s attention and concentration can be attributable to alertness to danger and exaggerated startle responses to reminders of the trauma.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Interpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly exacerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of PTSD, rather than a personality disorder, in which such difficulties would be expected independently of any traumatic exposure.</p>

					<p><strong>Dissociative disorders.</strong>
						<br>Dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and depersonalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by exposure to a traumatic event or may or may not have co-occurring PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria are also met, however, the PTSD “with dissociative symptoms” subtype should be considered.</p>

					<p><strong>Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder).</strong>
						<br>New onset of somatic symptoms within the context of posttraumatic distress might be an indication of PTSD rather than functional neurological symptom disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Flashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders; depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features; delirium; substance/medication-induced disorders; and psychotic disorders due to another medical condition. PTSD flashbacks are distinguished from these other perceptual disturbances by being directly related to the traumatic experience and by occurring in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features.</p>

					<p><strong>Traumatic brain injury.</strong>
						<br>Some types of traumatic events increase risk of both PTSD and traumatic brain injury (TBI) because they can produce head injuries (e.g., military combat, bomb blasts, child physical abuse, intimate partner violence, violent crime, motor vehicle or other accidents). In such cases, individuals presenting with PTSD may also have TBI, and those presenting with TBI may also have PTSD. Individuals with PTSD who also have TBI may have persistent postconcussive symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits). However, such symptoms may also occur in non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD. Because symptoms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between PTSD and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD. TBI-related memory problems concerning the traumatic event are typically attributable to injury-related inability to encode the information, whereas PTSD-related memory problems typically reflect dissociative amnesia. Sleep difficulties are common to both disorders.</p>

					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Adjustment disorders.</strong>
						<br>In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder. The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the criteria for acute stress disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and when the symptom pattern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired). For example, severe stress reactions to life-threatening illnesses that may include some acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately described as an adjustment disorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms and may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appropriately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an adjustment disorder may involve rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Spontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder. However, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are unexpected and there is anxiety about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior associated with fear of dire consequences of the attacks.</p>

					<p><strong>Dissociative disorders.</strong>
						<br>Severe dissociative responses (in the absence of characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms) may be diagnosed as derealization/depersonalization disorder. If severe amnesia of the trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom pattern in acute stress disorder must resolve within 1 month of the traumatic event. If the symptoms persist for more than 1 month and meet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed from acute stress disorder to PTSD.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>In obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent intrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of acute stress disorder are typically absent.</p>

					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Flashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a delirium, substance/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to another medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are distinguished from these other perceptual disturbances by being directly related to the traumatic experience and by occurring in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features.</p>

					<p><strong>Traumatic brain injury.</strong>
						<br>When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g., traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of acute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event, and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with acute stress disorder. Because symptoms of acute stress disorder and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between acute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder and not the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to acute stress disorder. Furthermore, differential is aided by the fact that symptoms of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma exposure.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>If an individual has symptoms that meet criteria for a major depressive disorder in response to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is not applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive disorder differentiates it from adjustment disorders.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing adjustment disorders from these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and symptom profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately and persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic event, whereas acute stress disorder can only occur between 3 days and 1 month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD cannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the occurrence of the traumatic stressor. The required symptom profiles for PTSD and acute stress disorder differentiate them from the adjustment disorders. With regard to symptom profiles, an adjustment disorder may be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individual exhibits symptoms of either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic threshold for either disorder. Because adjustment disorder cannot persist for more than 6 months after termination of the stressor or its consequences, cases in which symptoms occurring in response to a traumatic event that fall short of the diagnostic threshold for PTSD and that persist for longer than 6 months should be diagnosed as other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be diagnosed for individuals who have not been exposed to a traumatic event meeting Criterion A for PTSD, but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom profile of either acute stress disorder or PTSD.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>With regard to personality disorders, some personality features may be associated with a vulnerability to situational distress that may resemble an adjustment disorder. The lifetime history of personality functioning will help inform the interpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in distinguishing a long-standing personality disorder from an adjustment disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring vulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality disorder symptoms. In the presence of a personality disorder, if the symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder are met, and the stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to maladaptive personality disorder symptoms (i.e., Criterion C is met), then the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder should be made.</p>

					<p><strong>Bereavement.</strong>
						<br>Clinically significant acute bereavement-related distress may sometimes be diagnosed as an adjustment disorder if the bereavement is judged to be out of proportion to what would be expected or significantly impairs self-care and interpersonal relations. When such symptoms persist for more than 12 months after the death, the diagnosis is either prolonged grief disorder if full criteria are met or else other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, specific psychological entities (e.g., psychological symptoms, behaviors, other factors) exacerbate a medical condition. These psychological factors can precipitate, exacerbate, or put an individual at risk for medical illness, or they can worsen an existing condition. In contrast, an adjustment disorder is a reaction to the stressor (e.g., having a medical illness).</p>

					<p><strong>Normative stress reactions.</strong>
						<br>When bad things happen, most people get upset. This is not an adjustment disorder. The diagnosis should only be made when the magnitude of the distress (e.g., alterations in mood, anxiety, or conduct) exceeds what would normally be expected (which may vary in different cultures) or when the adverse event precipitates functional impairment.</p>

					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normal grief.</strong>
						<br>Prolonged grief disorder is distinguished from normal grief by the presence of severe grief reactions that persist at least 12 months (6 months in children or adolescents) after the death of a person who was close to the bereaved individual. It is only when severe levels of grief response persist for the specified duration following the death, interfere with the individual’s capacity to function, and exceed cultural, social, or religious norms that prolonged grief disorder is diagnosed. In evaluating the requirement for clinically significant symptoms to be present most days over the past month, it should be noted that marked increases in grief severity can be seen in normal grieving around calendar days that are reminders of the loss, such as the anniversary of the death, birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and holidays; this exacerbation of grief severity does not by itself, in the absence of persistent grief at other times, constitute evidence of prolonged grief disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Prolonged grief disorder, major depressive disorder, and persistent depressive disorder share several symptoms, including low mood, crying, and suicidal thinking. However, in prolonged grief disorder the distress is focused on feelings of loss and separation from a loved one rather than reflecting generalized low mood. Major depressive disorder may also be preceded by the death of a loved one, with or without comorbid prolonged grief disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals who experience bereavement as a result of violent or accidental death may develop both PTSD and prolonged grief disorder. Both conditions can involve intrusive thoughts and avoidance. Whereas intrusions in PTSD revolve around the traumatic event (which may have caused the death of a loved one), intrusive memories in prolonged grief disorder focus on thoughts about many aspects of the relationship with the deceased, including positive aspects of the relationship and distress over the separation. Unlike avoidance in PTSD, which is manifested by avoidance of memories, thoughts, or feelings associated with the traumatic event that led to the death of the loved one (e.g., memories of the fatal automobile accident that killed the loved one), the avoidance in prolonged grief disorder is of reminders that the loved one is no longer present (e.g., avoidance of activities carried out together with the deceased). Moreover, reexperiencing memories in PTSD tend to be more perceptual, with the individual reporting that the memory feels like it is occurring in the “here and now,” which tends not to be the case in prolonged grief disorder. In prolonged grief disorder, there is also a yearning for the deceased, which is absent in PTSD.</p>

					<p><strong>Separation anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by anxiety about separation from current attachment figures, whereas prolonged grief disorder involves distress about separation from a deceased person.</p>

					<p><strong>Psychotic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Hallucinations about the deceased (e.g., seeing the deceased in a favorite chair) or transient sensations about the presence of the deceased (e.g., by touch, voice, or sight) are common cross-culturally during normal grief, may be experienced as reassuring, and often occur while the individual is falling asleep (hypnagogic). To receive a diagnosis of psychotic disorder, individuals with prolonged grief disorder must also endorse other symptoms of psychosis, such as delusions, disorganized thinking, or negative symptoms.</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder<br>F43.8</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a trauma- and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific trauma- and stressor-related disorder. This is done by recording “other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “persistent response to trauma with PTSD-like symptoms”).</p>

The unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific trauma- and stressor-related disorder and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).</p>

					<h3>Dissociative Identity Disorder<br>F44.81</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompanied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.</li>
						<li>Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information, and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.</li>

						<li>The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Dissociative amnesia.</strong>
						<br>Both dissociative identity disorder and dissociative amnesia are characterized by gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information, or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting. Dissociative identity disorder is distinguished from dissociative amnesia by the additional presence of identity disruption characterized by two or more distinct personality states.</p>

					<p><strong>Depersonalization/derealization disorder.</strong>
						<br>The essential feature of depersonalization/derealization disorder is persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder do not experience the presence of personality/identity states with alterations of self and agency, nor do they typically report dissociative amnesia.</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Most individuals with dissociative identity disorder endorse a lifelong negative posttraumatic emotional state, often with childhood onset, and their symptoms may appear to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. Moreover, posttraumatic reactivity to times of year when trauma occurred (anniversary reactions), primarily manifesting with more despondency, distress, and suicidal ideation, may also appear to be major depressive disorder, with seasonal pattern. However, individuals with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder do not experience dissociative fluctuations in self and agency and dissociative amnesia. It is important to assess if all or most identity states are experiencing the adverse mood state, since mood disorder symptoms may fluctuate because they are experienced in some identity states, but not others.</p>

					<p><strong>Bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>Dissociative identity disorder is commonly misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder, typically bipolar II disorder, with mixed features. The relatively rapid shifts in behavioral state in individuals with dissociative identity disorder—usually within minutes or hours—are atypical for even the most rapid-cycling individuals with bipolar disorders. These state alterations are due to rapidly shifting dissociative states and/or fluctuating posttraumatic intrusions. Sometimes these shifts are accompanied by rapid changes in levels of activation, but these usually last minutes to hours, not days, and are associated with activation of specific identity states. Elevated or depressed mood may be experienced as loculated in specific identities, through overlap/interference phenomena. Usually, the individual with dissociative identity disorder does not have a classic bipolar sleep disturbance (e.g., reduced need for sleep), instead suffering from chronic, severe nightmares and nocturnal flashbacks that interrupt sleep.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>A majority of individuals with dissociative identity disorder will have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for comorbid PTSD. Dissociative symptoms characteristic of dissociative identity disorder should be differentiated from the dissociative amnesia, dissociative flashbacks, and depersonalization/derealization characteristic of acute stress disorder, PTSD, or the dissociative subtype of PTSD. Dissociative amnesia in PTSD typically manifests only for specific traumatic events or aspects of traumatic events, as opposed to the chronic, complex dissociative amnesia characteristic of dissociative identity disorder. Depersonalization/derealization symptoms in the dissociative subtype of PTSD are related to specific posttraumatic reminders. Depersonalization/derealization symptoms in dissociative identity disorder may occur not only in response to posttraumatic reminders, but also in an ongoing fashion in daily life, including in response to stressful interpersonal interactions and when there is overlap/interference between states.</p>

					<p><strong>Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may experience symptoms that can superficially appear similar to those of psychotic disorders. These include auditory hallucinations and symptoms characteristic of intrusions of personality states into the individual’s awareness; these symptoms can seemingly resemble some of the Schneiderian first-rank symptoms formerly considered indicative of schizophrenia (e.g., thought broadcasting, thought insertion, thought withdrawal, hearing voices keeping up a running commentary about the individual). For example, hearing different personality states discussing the individual can resemble auditory hallucinations of voices arguing in schizophrenia. The individual with dissociative identity disorder may also experience the thoughts or emotions of an intruding personality state, which can resemble thought insertion in schizophrenia, as well as experience the sudden disappearance of these thoughts or emotions, which can resemble thought withdrawal. Such experiences in an individual with schizophrenia are usually accompanied by delusional beliefs about the cause of those symptoms (i.e., thoughts being inserted by an outside force), whereas individuals with dissociative identity disorder typically experience these symptoms as ego-alien and frightening. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may also report a range of visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, and somatic hallucinations, which are usually related to autohypnotic, posttraumatic, and dissociative factors, such as partial flashbacks, in contrast to individuals with schizophrenia, whose hallucinations are primarily auditory and less commonly visual. Dissociative identity disorder and psychotic disorders are therefore distinguished by symptoms characteristic of one of these conditions and not the other (e.g., dissociative amnesia in dissociative identity disorder and not in psychotic disorders). Finally, individuals with schizophrenia have low hypnotic capacity, whereas individuals with dissociative identity disorder have the highest hypnotic capacity among all clinical groups.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with dissociative identity disorder frequently have a current or past history of substance use disorders. Symptoms associated with the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts) should be distinguished from dissociative amnesia in dissociative identity disorder if the substance in question is judged to be etiologically related to the memory loss.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with dissociative identity disorder often present identities that appear to encapsulate a variety of severe personality disorder features, suggesting a differential diagnosis of personality disorder, especially of the borderline type. Importantly, however, the individual’s longitudinal variability in personality style (attributable to inconsistency among identities) differs from the pervasive and persistent dysfunction in affect management and interpersonal relationships typical of those with personality disorders.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury.</strong>
						<br>Both dissociative identity disorder and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are characterized by gaps in memory. Other characteristics of TBI include loss of consciousness, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological signs and symptoms. A neurocognitive disorder due to TBI manifests either immediately after brain injury occurs or immediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury, and persists past the acute postinjury period. The cognitive presentation of a neurocognitive disorder following TBI is variable and includes difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive function, and learning and memory, as well as slowed speed of information processing and disturbances in social cognition. While depersonalization is not uncommon following TBI, the additional neurocognitive features noted above help distinguish it from dissociative amnesia that is part of dissociative identity disorder. Moreover, dissociative amnesia occurring in the context of dissociative identity disorder is accompanied by a marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, which are not features of TBI.</p>

					<p><strong>Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder).</strong>
						<br>Functional neurological symptom disorder may be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the absence of identity alteration characterized by two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession. Dissociative amnesia in functional neurological symptom disorder is more limited and circumscribed (e.g., amnesia for a nonepileptic seizure).</p>

					<p><strong>Factitious disorder and malingering.</strong>
						<br>Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder usually do not report the subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; instead they tend to overreport media-based symptoms of the disorder, such as dramatic dissociative amnesia and melodramatic switching behaviors, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid symptoms, such as depression. Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder tend to be relatively undisturbed by or may even seem to enjoy “having” the disorder, or may ask clinicians to “find” traumatic memories. In contrast, most individuals with genuine dissociative identity disorder are ashamed of and overwhelmed by their symptoms, deny the diagnosis, underreport their symptoms, and display minimization and avoidance of their trauma history.<br>Individuals who feign the symptoms of dissociative identity disorder usually create limited, stereotyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia related only to the events for which gain is sought, with apparent switching behaviors and amnesia only displayed while being observed. They may present an “all-good” identity and an “all-bad” identity in hopes of gaining exculpation for a crime.</p>

						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Dissociative identity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Recurrent episodes of dissociative amnesia may be attributable to dissociative identity disorder. Individuals with dissociative amnesia may report depersonalization and auto-hypnotic symptoms, as do individuals with dissociative identity disorder. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder report pervasive discontinuities in sense of self and agency, accompanied by many other dissociative symptoms. Amnesias in dissociative identity disorder, in addition to retrospective autobiographical memory deficits, include ongoing amnesia (“time loss”) for everyday events and interpersonal interactions; finding unexplained possessions; perplexing major fluctuations in skills and knowledge; and frequent, brief amnesic gaps during interpersonal interactions.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals with PTSD cannot recall part or all of a specific traumatic event (e.g., a rape victim who cannot recall most events for the entire day of the rape). When that amnesia extends to events beyond the immediate time of the trauma, a comorbid diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be warranted. Individuals with the dissociative subtype of PTSD may also report dissociative amnesia in addition to depersonalization/derealization.</p>

					<p><strong>Neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>In major neurocognitive disorders, there is typically evidence of neural tissue damage accompanied by a decline in cognitive function with deficits in attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, and perceptual-motor and social cognition that impair capacity for independent everyday activities. Memory loss for personal information is usually embedded in cognitive, linguistic, affective, attentional, and behavioral disturbances. Generally, awareness of personal identity is spared until late in the course of the neurocognitive disorder. In neurocognitive disorders, retrograde amnesia is almost always accompanied by anterograde amnesia. Anterograde dissociative amnesia can be confused with delirium. However, medical, laboratory, toxicological, and neurological workups, including imaging studies, are normal. Careful, repeated evaluations over time will show that as in other forms of dissociative amnesia, there are no true neurocognitive deficits.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance-related disorders.</strong>
						<br>In the context of repeated intoxication with alcohol or other substances/medications, there may be episodes of “blackouts” or periods for which the individual has no memory, or partial memory (“grayouts”). To aid in distinguishing these episodes from dissociative amnesia, a longitudinal history should show that the amnestic episodes occur only in the context of intoxication. However, the distinction may be difficult when the individual with dissociative amnesia also misuses alcohol or other substances, particularly in the context of stressful situations that may also exacerbate dissociative symptoms. This can be a more complex differential diagnosis when the substance use begins in childhood or adolescence, generally in the context of intrafamilial abuse, neglect, and substance-related disorders. Sequential observation of these individuals after detoxification, along with carefully taken history, usually can distinguish the memory loss attributable to long-standing substance use from dissociative amnesia. Some individuals with comorbid dissociative amnesia and substance use disorders will attempt to minimize their dissociative amnesia and attribute memory problems solely to the substance use. Prolonged use of alcohol or other substances may result in a substance-induced neurocognitive disorder that may be associated with impaired cognitive function. However, in this context the protracted history of substance use and the persistent deficits associated with the neurocognitive disorder would serve to distinguish it from dissociative amnesia, where there is typically no evidence of persistent impairment in intellectual functioning.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury.</strong>
						<br>Amnesia may occur in the context of a TBI when there has been an impact to the head or other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull. Other characteristics of TBI include loss of consciousness, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological signs and symptoms (e.g., abnormalities on neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia). A neurocognitive disorder attributable to TBI must present either immediately after brain injury occurs or immediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury, and persist past the acute postinjury period. The cognitive presentation of a neurocognitive disorder following TBI is variable and includes difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, as well as slowed speed of information processing and disturbances in social cognition. The patterns of memory deficits are typical of neurocognitive disorders. Mild TBI may precede acute dissociative amnesia presentations, but the dissociative memory deficits are out of proportion to the TBI head trauma and typically follow the dissociative, not the neurocognitive, patterns.</p>

					<p><strong>Seizure disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior during seizures or postictally with subsequent amnesia. Some individuals with a seizure disorder engage in nonpurposive wandering that is limited to the period of seizure activity. Conversely, behavior during a dissociative fugue is usually purposeful, complex, and goal-directed and may last for days, weeks, or longer. Occasionally, individuals with a seizure disorder will report that some autobiographical memories have been “wiped out” as the seizure disorder progresses. Such memory loss is not associated with psychological trauma or adversities and appears to occur randomly. In seizure disorders, serial electroencephalograms usually show abnormalities. Telemetric electroencephalographic monitoring generally shows an association between the episodes of amnesia and seizure activity. Dissociative and epileptic amnesias may coexist.</p>

					<p><strong>Memory deficits associated with electroconvulsive therapy.</strong>
						<br>Memory deficits after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) most commonly occur for the day of ECT administration. More extensive retrograde and even anterograde amnesia after ECT is usually unrelated to stressful or traumatic life epochs, and generally remits after the ECT series concludes. ECT in severely depressed individuals with dissociative disorders does not worsen dissociation, and memory access may improve as depression remits.</p>

					<p><strong>Catatonic stupor.</strong>
						<br>Mutism in catatonic stupor may suggest dissociative amnesia, but failure of recall is usually absent. Other catatonic symptoms (e.g., rigidity, posturing, negativism) are usually present. Catatonic symptoms in children can be associated with trauma, abuse, and/or deprivation. Unlike in dissociative amnesia, the pattern of memory loss in catatonia is only for the catatonic episode.</p>

					<p><strong>Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events (other specified dissociative disorder).</strong>
						<br>The acute dissociative reactions to stressful events example of other specified dissociative disorder is characterized by a combination of dissociative symptoms that occur together acutely in response to stressful events and typically last less than 1 month. Amnestic episodes that occur as part of these reactions are accompanied by other prominent dissociative symptoms, have a short duration (hours or days), and tend to be circumscribed to limited periods or events in a person’s life (micro-amnesias).</p>

					<p><strong>Factitious disorder and malingering.</strong>
						<br>There is no test, battery of tests, or set of procedures that invariably distinguishes dissociative amnesia from feigned amnesia. Feigned amnesia is more common in individuals with 1) acute, florid dissociative amnesia; 2) financial, sexual, or legal problems; 3) a wish to escape stressful circumstances; 4) a desire to seem to be a more interesting patient; and/or 5) a plan to engage in litigation for “recovered memories.” However, dissociative amnesia can be associated with those same circumstances and can coexist with deliberate feigning. Many individuals who malinger amnesia confess spontaneously or when confronted.</p>

					<p><strong>Memory changes with aging or mild neurocognitive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Memory decrements in mild neurocognitive disorder differ from those of dissociative amnesia; in mild neurocognitive disorder, memory changes manifest as difficulty in learning and retaining new information. This is often measured in tests of verbal learning of word lists or a brief story with evaluation of immediate and delayed recall. With normal cognitive aging, individuals may also have similar weaknesses in immediate and delayed recall of new information, although normal aging may also affect information processing speed and other complex executive function tasks in addition to memory.</p>

					<h3>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder<br>F48.1</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li><strong>Depersonalization:</strong> Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside observer with respect to one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions (e.g., perceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/or physical numbing).</li>
							<li><strong>Derealization:</strong> Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to surroundings (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted).</li>
						</ul>
						<li>During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact.</li>
						<li>The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or another medical condition (e.g., seizures).</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or another dissociative disorder.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Illness anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Although individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder can present with vague somatic complaints as well as fears of permanent brain damage, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by the presence of a constellation of typical depersonalization/derealization symptoms and the absence of other manifestations of illness anxiety disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Feelings of numbness, deadness, apathy, and being in a dream are not uncommon in major depressive episodes. However, in depersonalization/derealization disorder, such symptoms are associated with further symptoms of the disorder. If the depersonalization/derealization clearly precedes the onset of a major depressive episode or clearly continues after its resolution, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder applies.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder can become obsessively preoccupied with their subjective experience or develop rituals checking on the status of their symptoms. However, other symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder unrelated to depersonalization/derealization are not present.</p>

					<p><strong>Other dissociative disorders.</strong>
						<br>In order to diagnose depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms should not occur in the context of another dissociative disorder, such as dissociative identity disorder. Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) is simpler, as the symptoms of these disorders do not overlap with those of depersonalization/derealization disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Panic attacks.</strong>
						<br>Depersonalization/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic attacks, increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore, depersonalization/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when the symptoms occur only during panic attacks that are part of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific phobia. In addition, it is not uncommon for depersonalization/derealization symptoms to first begin in the context of new-onset panic attacks or as panic disorder progresses and worsens. In such presentations, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder can be made if 1) the depersonalization/derealization component of the presentation is very prominent from the start, clearly exceeding in duration and intensity the occurrence of actual panic attacks; or 2) the depersonalization/derealization continues after panic disorder has remitted or has been successfully treated.</p>

					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>The presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the depersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating depersonalization/derealization disorder from psychotic disorders. Rarely, positive-symptom schizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge when nihilistic delusions are present. For example, an individual may complain that he or she is dead or the world is not real; this could be either a subjective experience that the individual knows is not true or a delusional conviction.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced disorders.</strong>
						<br>Depersonalization/derealization associated with the physiological effects of substances during acute intoxication or withdrawal is not diagnosed as depersonalization/derealization disorder. The most common precipitating substances are the illicit drugs marijuana, hallucinogens, ketamine, ecstasy, and salvia. In about 15% of all cases of depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms are precipitated by ingestion of such substances. If the symptoms persist for some time in the absence of any further substance or medication use, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder applies. This diagnosis is usually easy to establish since the vast majority of individuals with this presentation become highly phobic and aversive to the triggering substance and do not use it again.</p>

					<p><strong>Traumatic brain injury.</strong>
						<br>Depersonalization/derealization symptoms are typical in traumatic brain injury (TBI) but are distinguished from depersonalization/derealization disorder by onset of symptoms following TBI and the lack of other symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Dissociative symptoms due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Features such as onset after age 40 years or the presence of atypical symptoms and course in any individual suggest the possibility of an underlying medical condition. In cases with dissociative symptoms, it is essential to conduct a thorough medical and neurological evaluation, which may include standard laboratory studies, viral titers, an electroencephalogram, vestibular testing, visual testing, sleep studies, and/or brain imaging. When the suspicion of an underlying seizure disorder proves difficult to confirm, an ambulatory electroencephalogram may be indicated; although temporal lobe epilepsy is most commonly implicated, parietal and frontal lobe epilepsy may also be associated.</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Dissociative Disorder<br>F44.89</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific dissociative disorder. This is done by recording “other specified dissociative disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “dissociative trance”).</p>

					<p>Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:
						<ul class="number">
							<li><strong>Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms:</strong> This category includes identity disturbance associated with less-than-marked discontinuities in sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia.</li>
							<li><strong>Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion:</strong> Individuals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion (e.g., brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with prolonged changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity.</li>
							<li><strong>Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events:</strong> This category is for acute, transient conditions that typically last less than 1 month, and sometimes only a few hours or days. These conditions are characterized by constriction of consciousness; depersonalization; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slowing, macropsia); microamnesias; transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-motor functioning (e.g., analgesia, paralysis).</li>
							<li><strong>Dissociative trance:</strong> This condition is characterized by an acute narrowing or complete loss of awareness of immediate surroundings that manifests as profound unresponsiveness or insensitivity to environmental stimuli. The unresponsiveness may be accompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors (e.g., finger movements) of which the individual is unaware and/or that he or she cannot control, as well as transient paralysis or loss of consciousness. The dissociative trance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.</li>

					<h3>Unspecified Dissociative Disorder<br>F44.9</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific dissociative disorder and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).</p>

					<h3>Somatic Symptom Disorder<br>F45.1</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life.</li>
						<li>Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symptoms.</li>
							<li>Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms.</li>
							<li>Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns.</li>

						<li>Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>With predominant pain (previously pain disorder):</strong> This specifier is for individuals whose somatic symptoms predominantly involve pain.</li>
						</ul></p>

					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>Persistent:</strong> A persistent course is characterized by severe symptoms, marked impairment, and long duration (more than 6 months).</li>
						</ul></p>

					<p>Specify current severity:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>Mild:</strong> Only one of the symptoms specified in Criterion B is fulfilled.</li>
							<li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are fulfilled.</li>
							<li><strong>Severe:</strong> Two or more of the symptoms specified in Criterion B are fulfilled, plus there are multiple somatic complaints (or one very severe somatic symptom).</li>
						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>If the somatic symptoms are consistent with another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder), and the diagnostic criteria for that disorder are fulfilled, then that mental disorder should be considered as an alternative or additional diagnosis. If, as commonly occurs, the criteria for both somatic symptom disorder and another mental disorder diagnosis are fulfilled, then both should be diagnosed, as both may require treatment.</p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>The presence of somatic symptoms of unclear etiology is not in itself sufficient to make the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. The symptoms of many individuals with disorders like irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia would not satisfy the criterion necessary to diagnose somatic symptom disorder (Criterion B). Conversely, the presence of somatic symptoms of an established medical condition (e.g., diabetes or heart disease) does not exclude the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder if the criteria are otherwise met. Factors that distinguish individuals with somatic symptom disorder from individuals with general medical conditions alone include the ineffectiveness of analgesics, a history of mental disorders, unclear provocative or palliative factors, persistence without cessation, and stress.</p>

					<p><strong>Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder requires distressing or impairing somatic symptoms that may or may not be associated with another medical condition but must be accompanied by excessive or disproportionate thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns. In contrast, the diagnosis of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions requires the presence of a medical condition, as well as psychological factors that adversely affect its course or interfere with its treatment.</p>

					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>In panic disorder, somatic symptoms and anxiety about health tend to occur in acute episodes, whereas in somatic symptom disorder, anxiety and somatic symptoms are more persistent.</p>

					<p><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry about multiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve their health. The main focus is not usually somatic symptoms or fear of illness as it is in somatic symptom disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Depressive disorders are commonly accompanied by somatic symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, or joint, abdominal, or other pains. However, depressive disorders are differentiated from somatic symptom disorder by the requirement of the presence of depressed mood or, in the case of major depressive disorder, either depressed mood or decreased interest or pleasure in activities. In some cultural contexts, these core symptoms of depression may be initially denied or deemphasized by individuals whose presentations would otherwise meet criteria for a depressive disorder. Such individuals might instead emphasize somatic symptoms that may be idiomatic (e.g., heavy heart) and unfamiliar to clinicians.</p>

					<p><strong>Illness anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>If the individual has extensive worries about health but no or minimal somatic symptoms, it may be more appropriate to consider illness anxiety disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder).</strong>
						<br>In functional neurological symptom disorder, the presenting symptom is loss of function (e.g., of a limb), whereas in somatic symptom disorder, the focus is on the distress that particular symptoms cause. The features listed under Criterion B of somatic symptom disorder may be helpful in differentiating the two disorders.</p>

					<p><strong>Delusional disorder.</strong>
						<br>In somatic symptom disorder, the individual’s beliefs that somatic symptoms might reflect serious underlying physical illness are not held with delusional intensity. Nonetheless, the individual’s beliefs concerning the somatic symptoms can be firmly held. In contrast, in delusional disorder, somatic type, the individual’s conviction that the somatic symptoms are indicative of having a serious underlying illness is stronger than that found in somatic symptom disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder.</strong>
						<br>In body dysmorphic disorder, the individual is excessively concerned about, and preoccupied by, a perceived defect in his or her physical appearance. In contrast, in somatic symptom disorder, the concern about somatic symptoms reflects fear of underlying illness, not of a defect in appearance.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>In somatic symptom disorder, the recurrent ideas about somatic symptoms or illness are less intrusive, and individuals with this disorder do not exhibit the associated repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety that occur in obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Factitious disorder and malingering.</strong>
						<br>In factitious disorder and malingering, individuals present themselves as ill or impaired but have falsified presenting physical signs and symptoms with the intent to deceive. In contrast, the symptoms of somatic symptom disorder are not simulated or self-induced, and these individuals suffer authentically and seriously from their somatic complaints.</p>

					<h3>Illness Anxiety Disorder<br>F45.21</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness.</li>
						<li>Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity. If another medical condition is present or there is a high risk for developing a medical condition (e.g., strong family history is present), the preoccupation is clearly excessive or disproportionate.</li>
						<li>There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed about personal health status.</li>
						<li>The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctor appointments and hospitals).</li>
						<li>Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the specific illness that is feared may change over that period of time.</li>
						<li>The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Specify whether:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>Care-seeking type:</strong> Medical care, including physician visits or undergoing tests and procedures, is frequently used.</li>
							<li><strong>Care-avoidant type:</strong> Medical care is rarely used.</li>
						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>The first differential diagnostic consideration is an underlying medical condition, including neurological or endocrine conditions, occult malignancies, and other diseases that affect multiple body systems. The presence of a medical condition does not rule out the possibility of coexisting illness anxiety disorder. If a medical condition is present, the health- related anxiety and disease concerns are clearly disproportionate to its seriousness. Transient preoccupations related to a medical condition do not constitute illness anxiety disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Adjustment disorders.</strong>
						<br>Health-related anxiety is a normal response to serious illness and is not a mental disorder. Such nonpathological health anxiety is clearly related to the medical condition and is typically time-limited. If the health anxiety is severe enough to cause clinically significant distress or impairment in one or more important areas of functioning, an adjustment disorder may be diagnosed. However, if disproportionate health-related anxiety persists for longer than 6 months, a diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder may apply.</p>

					<p><strong>Somatic symptom disorder.</strong>
						<br>Both somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety disorder may be characterized by a high level of anxiety about health and excessive health-related behaviors. They are differentiated by the fact that somatic symptom disorder requires the presence of somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life, whereas in illness anxiety disorder, somatic symptoms either are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity.</p>

					<p><strong>Anxiety disorders.</strong>
						<br>In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals worry about multiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve health. In panic disorder, the individual may be concerned that the panic attacks reflect the presence of a medical illness; however, although these individuals may have health anxiety, their anxiety is typically very acute and episodic. In illness anxiety disorder, the health anxiety and fears are more persistent and enduring. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may experience panic attacks that are triggered by their illness concerns.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have intrusive thoughts about having a disease and also may have associated compulsive behaviors (e.g., seeking reassurance). However, in illness anxiety disorder, the preoccupations are usually focused on having a disease, whereas in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the thoughts are intrusive and are usually focused on fears of getting a disease in the future. Most individuals with OCD have obsessions or compulsions involving other concerns in addition to fears about contracting disease. In body dysmorphic disorder, concerns are limited to the individual’s physical appearance, which is viewed as defective or flawed.</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals with a major depressive episode ruminate about their health and worry excessively about illness. A separate diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is not made if these concerns occur only during major depressive episodes. However, if excessive illness worry persists after remission of an episode of major depressive disorder, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be considered.</p>

					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and can acknowledge the possibility that the feared disease is not present. Their ideas do not attain the rigidity and intensity seen in the somatic delusions occurring in psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder, somatic type; major depressive disorder, with psychotic features). True somatic delusions are generally more bizarre (e.g., that an organ is rotting or dead) than the concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder. The concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder, though not founded in reality, are plausible.</p>

						<li>Clinical findings provide evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions.</li>
						<li>The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder.</li>
						<li>The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM code depends on the symptom type (see below).</p>

					<p>Specify symptom type:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>F44.4 With weakness or paralysis</strong></li>
							<li><strong>F44.4 With abnormal movement</strong> (e.g., tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, gait disorder)</li>
							<li><strong>F44.4 With swallowing symptoms</strong></li>
							<li><strong>F44.4 With speech symptom</strong> (e.g., dysphonia, slurred speech)</li>
							<li><strong>F44.5 With attacks or seizures</strong></li>
							<li><strong>F44.6 With anesthesia or sensory loss</strong></li>
							<li><strong>F44.6 With special sensory symptom</strong> (e.g., visual, olfactory, or hearing disturbance)</li>
							<li><strong>F44.7 With mixed symptoms</strong></li>
						</ul></p>

					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>Acute episode:</strong> Symptoms present for less than 6 months.
							<li><strong>Persistent:</strong> Symptoms occurring for 6 months or more.</li>
						</ul></p>

					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>With psychological stressor</strong> (specify stressor)</li>
							<li><strong>Without psychological stressor</strong></li>
						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Recognized neurological disease.</strong>
						<br>The main differential diagnosis is recognized neurological disease that might better explain the symptoms. After a thorough neurological assessment, an unexpected neurological disease cause for the symptoms is rarely found at follow-up. However, reassessment may be required if the symptoms appear to be progressive. Functional neurological symptom disorder commonly coexists with recognized neurological disease and may be part of the prodromal state of some progressive neurological diseases.</p>

					<p><strong>Somatic symptom disorder.</strong>
						<br>Functional neurological symptom disorder may be diagnosed in addition to somatic symptom disorder. Most of the somatic symptoms encountered in somatic symptom disorder cannot be demonstrated to be clearly incompatible with recognized neurological or medical disease, whereas in functional neurological symptom disorder, such incompatibility is required for the diagnosis.</p>

					<p><strong>Factitious disorder and malingering.</strong>
						<br>Functional neurological symptom disorder describes genuinely experienced symptoms that are not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned). However, definite evidence of feigning (e.g., marked discrepancy between reported and observed activities of daily living) would suggest malingering if the individual’s apparent aim is to obtain an obvious external reward, or factitious disorder in the absence of such reward.</p>

					<p><strong>Dissociative disorders.</strong>
						<br>Dissociative symptoms are common in individuals with functional neurological symptom disorder. If both functional neurological symptom disorder and a dissociative disorder are present, both diagnoses should be made.</p>

					<p><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are excessively concerned about a perceived defect in their physical appearance but do not complain of symptoms of sensory or motor functioning in the affected body part.</p>

					<p><strong>Depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>In depressive disorders, individuals may report general heaviness of their limbs, whereas the weakness of functional neurological symptom disorder is more focal and prominent. Depressive disorders are also differentiated by the presence of core depressive symptoms.</p>

					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Episodic neurological symptoms (e.g., tremor and paresthesia) can occur in both functional neurological symptom disorder and panic attacks. In panic attacks, the neurological symptoms are typically associated with characteristic cardiorespiratory symptoms and retained awareness. Loss of awareness with amnesia for the attack occurs in functional seizures but not in panic attacks.</p>

					<h3>Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present.</li>
						<li>Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of the following ways:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as shown by a close temporal association between the psychological factors and the development or exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the medical condition.</li>
							<li>The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor adherence).</li>
							<li>The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual.</li>
							<li>The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology, precipitating or exacerbating symptoms or necessitating medical attention.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Specify current severity:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>Mild:</strong> Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence with antihypertension treatment).</li>
							<li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety aggravating asthma).</li>
							<li><strong>Severe:</strong> Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room visit.</li>
							<li><strong>Extreme:</strong> Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring heart attack symptoms).</li>
						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Mental disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>A temporal association between symptoms of a mental disorder and those of a medical condition is also characteristic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition, but the presumed causality is in the opposite direction. In a mental disorder due to another medical condition, the medical condition is judged to be causing the mental disorder through a direct physiological mechanism. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the psychological or behavioral factors are judged to affect the course of the medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Adjustment disorders.</strong>
						<br>Abnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant psychological response to an identifiable stressor). For example, an individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes enraged would be diagnosed as having psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, whereas an individual with angina who developed maladaptive anticipatory anxiety would be diagnosed as having an adjustment disorder with anxiety. In clinical practice, however, psychological factors and a medical condition are often mutually exacerbating (e.g., anxiety as both a precipitant and a consequence of angina), in which case the distinction is arbitrary. Other mental disorders frequently result in medical complications, most notably substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder). If an individual has a coexisting major mental disorder that adversely affects or causes another medical condition, diagnoses of the mental disorder and the medical condition are usually sufficient. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is diagnosed when the psychological traits or behaviors do not meet criteria for a mental diagnosis.</p>

					<p><strong>Somatic symptom disorder.</strong>
						<br>Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by a combination of distressing somatic symptoms and excessive or maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in response to these symptoms or associated health concerns. The individual may or may not have a diagnosable medical condition. In contrast, in psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the psychological factors adversely affect a medical condition; the individual’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior are not necessarily excessive. The difference is one of emphasis, rather than a clear-cut distinction. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the emphasis is on the exacerbation of the medical condition (e.g., an individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes anxious). In somatic symptom disorder, the emphasis is on maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behavior (e.g., an individual with angina who worries constantly that she will have a heart attack, takes her blood pressure multiple times per day, and restricts her activities).</p>

					<p><strong>Illness anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by high illness anxiety that is distressing and/or disruptive to daily life with minimal somatic symptoms. The focus of clinical concern is the individual’s worry about having a disease; in most cases, no serious disease is present. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, anxiety may be a relevant psychological factor affecting a medical condition, but the clinical concern is the adverse effects on the medical condition.</p>

							<li><strong>Single episode</strong>
							<li><strong>Recurrent episodes</strong> (two or more events of falsification of illness and/or induction of injury)</li>
						</ul></p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Deception to avoid legal liability.</strong>
						<br>Caregivers who lie about abuse injuries in dependents solely to protect themselves from liability are not diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on another because protection from liability is an external reward (Criterion C, the deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external rewards). Such caregivers who, upon observation, analysis of medical records, and/or interviews with others, are found to lie more extensively than needed for immediate self-protection are diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on another.</p>

					<p><strong>Somatic symptom and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>In somatic symptom disorder and the care-seeking type of illness anxiety disorder, there may be excessive attention and treatment seeking for perceived medical concerns, but there is no evidence that the individual is providing false information or behaving deceptively.</p>

					<p><strong>Malingering.</strong>
						<br>Malingering is differentiated from factitious disorder by the intentional reporting of symptoms for personal gain (e.g., money, time off work). In contrast, the diagnosis of factitious disorder requires that the illness falsification is not fully accounted for by external rewards. Factitious disorder and malingering are not mutually exclusive, however. The motives in any single case might be multiple and shifting depending on the circumstances and reactions of others.</p>

					<p><strong>Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder).</strong>
						<br>Functional neurological symptom disorder is characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with neurological pathophysiology. Factitious disorder with neurological symptoms is distinguished from functional neurological symptom disorder by evidence of deceptive falsification of symptoms.</p>

					<p><strong>Borderline personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Deliberate physical self-harm in the absence of suicidal intent can also occur in association with other mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder. Factitious disorder requires that the induction of injury occur in association with deception.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Medical condition or mental disorder not associated with intentional symptom falsification</strong>
						<br>Presentation of signs and symptoms of illness that do not conform to an identifiable medical condition or mental disorder increases the likelihood of the presence of a factitious disorder. However, the diagnosis of factitious disorder does not exclude the presence of a true medical condition or mental disorder, as comorbid illness often occurs in the individual along with factitious disorder. For example, individuals who might manipulate blood sugar levels to produce symptoms may also have diabetes.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>Eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may occur during the course of other mental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) and in Kleine-Levin syndrome. In any such instance, an additional diagnosis of pica should be given only if the eating behavior is sufficiently persistent and severe to warrant additional clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Anorexia nervosa.</strong>
						<br>Pica can usually be distinguished from the other feeding and eating disorders by the consumption of nonnutritive, nonfood substances. It is important to note, however, that some presentations of anorexia nervosa include ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood substances, such as paper tissues, as a means of attempting to control appetite. In such cases, when the eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is primarily used as a means of weight control, anorexia nervosa should be the primary diagnosis.</p>

					<p><strong>Factitious disorder.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally ingest foreign objects as part of the pattern of falsification of physical symptoms. In such instances, there is an element of deception that is consistent with deliberate induction of injury or disease.</p>

							<li><strong>In remission:</strong> After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder were previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time.</li>
						</ul>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>Restriction of food intake is a nonspecific symptom that can accompany a number of mental disorders and medical conditions and that can also be developmentally appropriate. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed concurrently with the disorders below if all criteria are met, and the eating disturbance requires specific clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Other medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, food allergies and intolerances, occult malignancies).</strong>
						<br>Restriction of food intake may occur in other medical conditions, especially those with ongoing symptoms such as vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. A diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires that the disturbance of intake is beyond that directly accounted for by physical symptoms consistent with a medical condition; the eating disturbance may also persist after being triggered by a medical condition and following resolution of the medical condition.<br>Underlying medical or comorbid mental conditions may complicate feeding and eating. Because older individuals, postsurgical patients, and individuals receiving chemotherapy often lose their appetite, an additional diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires that the eating disturbance is a primary focus for intervention.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome.</strong>
						<br>Acute-onset symptoms, late age at onset, or atypical symptoms suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). PANS is characterized by abrupt, dramatic onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms or severely restricted food intake, together with a range of additional neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>

					<p><strong>Specific neurological/neuromuscular, structural, or congenital disorders and conditions associated with feeding difficulties.</strong>
						<br>Feeding difficulties are common in a number of congenital and neurological conditions often related to problems with oral/esophageal/pharyngeal structure and function, such as hypotonia of musculature, tongue protrusion, and unsafe swallowing. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed in individuals with such presentations as long as all diagnostic criteria are met.</p>

					<p><strong>Reactive attachment disorder.</strong>
						<br>Some degree of withdrawal from caregivers is characteristic of reactive attachment disorder and can lead to a disturbance in the caregiver-child relationship that can affect feeding and the child’s intake. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and the feeding disturbance is a primary focus for intervention.</p>

					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder often present with rigid eating behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivities. However, these features do not always result in the level of impairment that would be required for a diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment.</p>

					<p><strong>Specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, and other anxiety disorders.</strong>
						<br>Specific phobia, other type, includes as an example “situations that may lead to choking or vomiting” and can represent the primary trigger for the fear, anxiety, or avoidance required for diagnosis. Distinguishing specific phobia from avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be difficult when a fear of choking or vomiting has resulted in food avoidance. Although avoidance or restriction of food intake secondary to a pronounced fear of choking or vomiting can be conceptualized as specific phobia, in situations when the eating problem becomes the primary focus of clinical attention, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder becomes the appropriate diagnosis. In social anxiety disorder, the individual may present with a fear of being observed by others while eating, which can also occur in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Anorexia nervosa.</strong>
						<br>Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to significantly low body weight is a core feature of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals with anorexia nervosa also display a fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, as well as specific disturbances in relation to perception and experience of their own body weight and shape. These features are not present in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the two disorders should not be diagnosed concurrently. Differential diagnosis between avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and anorexia nervosa may be difficult, especially in late childhood and early adolescence, because these disorders may share a number of common symptoms (e.g., food avoidance, low weight). Differential diagnosis is also potentially difficult in individuals with anorexia nervosa who deny any fear of fatness but nonetheless engage in persistent behaviors that prevent weight gain and who do not recognize the medical seriousness of their low weight—a presentation sometimes termed “non–fat phobic anorexia nervosa.” Full consideration of symptoms, course, and family history is advised, and diagnosis may be best made in the context of a clinical relationship over time. In some individuals, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder might precede the onset of anorexia nervosa.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder may present with avoidance or restriction of intake in relation to preoccupations with food or ritualized eating behavior. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the aberrant eating is a major aspect of the clinical presentation requiring specific intervention.</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>In major depressive disorder, appetite might be affected to such an extent that individuals present with significantly restricted food intake, usually in relation to overall energy intake and often associated with weight loss. Usually appetite loss and related reduction of intake abate with resolution of mood problems. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should only be used concurrently if full criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment.</p>

					<p><strong>Schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other psychotic disorders may exhibit odd eating behaviors, avoidance of specific foods because of delusional beliefs, or other manifestations of avoidant or restrictive intake. In some cases, delusional beliefs may contribute to a concern about negative consequences of ingesting certain foods. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be used concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment.</p>

					<p><strong>Factitious disorder or factitious disorder imposed on another.</strong>
						<br>Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be differentiated from factitious disorder or factitious disorder imposed on another. In order to assume the sick role, some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally describe diets that are much more restrictive than those they are actually able to consume, as well as complications of such behavior, such as a need for enteral feedings or nutritional supplements, an inability to tolerate a normal range of foods, and/or an inability to participate normally in age-appropriate situations involving food. The presentation may be impressively dramatic and engaging, and the symptoms reported inconsistently. In factitious disorder imposed on another, the caregiver describes symptoms consistent with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and may induce physical symptoms such as failure to gain weight. As with any diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on another, the caregiver receives the diagnosis rather than the affected individual, and diagnosis should be made only on the basis of a careful, comprehensive assessment of the affected individual, the caregiver, and their interaction.</p>

					<p><strong>Developmentally normal behavior.</strong>
						<br>During normal development, some toddlers and children transiently narrow the variety of foods they are willing to eat. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as “picky eating,” usually resolves spontaneously without intervention. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not include such developmentally normal behaviors unless they become sufficiently severe to lead to failure to meet appropriate nutritional needs or produce significant impairment in functioning (Criterion A).</p>

							<li><strong>F50.02 Binge-eating/purging type:</strong> During the last 3 months, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge-eating or purging behavior (i.e., self- induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).</li>

						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>In addition to the general consideration of differential diagnosis for all cases, it is especially important to consider other possible causes of either significantly low body weight or significant weight loss when the presenting features are atypical (e.g., onset after age 40 years).</p>

					<p><strong>Medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, hyperthyroidism, occult malignancies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]).</strong>
						<br>Serious weight loss may occur in medical conditions, but individuals with these disorders usually do not also manifest a disturbance in the way their body weight or shape is experienced or an intense fear of weight gain or persist in behaviors that interfere with appropriate weight gain. Acute weight loss associated with a medical condition can occasionally be followed by the onset or recurrence of anorexia nervosa, which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical condition. Rarely, anorexia nervosa develops after bariatric surgery.</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>In major depressive disorder, severe weight loss may occur, but most individuals with major depressive disorder do not have either a desire for excessive weight loss or an intense fear of gaining weight.</p>

					<p><strong>Schizophrenia.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with schizophrenia may exhibit odd eating behavior and occasionally experience significant weight loss, but they rarely show the fear of gaining weight and the body image disturbance required for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with substance use disorders may experience low weight because of poor nutritional intake but generally do not fear gaining weight and do not manifest body image disturbance. Individuals who abuse substances that reduce appetite (e.g., cocaine, stimulants) and who also endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully evaluated for the possibility of comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that the substance use may represent a persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain (Criterion B).</p>

					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Some of the features of anorexia nervosa overlap with the criteria for social anxiety disorder, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder. Specifically, individuals may feel humiliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in public, as in social anxiety disorder; may exhibit obsessions and compulsions related to food, as in OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined defect in bodily appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder. If the individual with anorexia nervosa has social fears that are limited to eating behavior alone, the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should not be made, but social fears unrelated to eating behavior (e.g., excessive fear of speaking in public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Similarly, an additional diagnosis of OCD should be considered only if the individual exhibits obsessions and compulsions unrelated to food (e.g., an excessive fear of contamination), and an additional diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder should be considered only if the distortion is unrelated to body shape and size (e.g., preoccupation that one’s nose is too big).</p>

					<p><strong>Bulimia nervosa.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit recurrent episodes of binge eating, engage in inappropriate behavior to avoid weight gain (e.g., self-induced vomiting), and are overly concerned with body shape and weight. However, unlike individuals with anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type, individuals with bulimia nervosa maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal level.</p>

					<p><strong>Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with this disorder may exhibit significant weight loss or significant nutritional deficiency, but they do not have a fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, nor do they have a disturbance in the way they experience their body shape and weight.</p>

					<p><strong>Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type.</strong>
						<br>Individuals whose binge-eating behavior occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia nervosa, binge- eating/purging type, and should not be given the additional diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. For individuals with an initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa who binge and purge but whose presentation no longer meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type (e.g., when weight is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should be given only when all criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at least 3 months.</p>

					<p><strong>Binge-eating disorder.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals binge eat but do not engage in regular inappropriate compensatory behaviors. In these cases, the diagnosis of binge-eating disorder should be considered.</p>

					<p><strong>Kleine-Levin syndrome.</strong>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Bulimia nervosa.</strong>
						<br>Binge-eating disorder has recurrent binge eating in common with bulimia nervosa but differs from the latter disorder in some fundamental respects. In terms of clinical presentation, the recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior (e.g., purging, driven exercise) seen in bulimia nervosa is absent in binge-eating disorder. Unlike individuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge-eating disorder typically do not show marked or sustained dietary restriction designed to influence body weight and shape between binge-eating episodes. They may, however, report frequent attempts at dieting. Binge-eating disorder also differs from bulimia nervosa in terms of response to treatment. Rates of improvement are consistently higher among individuals with binge-eating disorder than among those with bulimia nervosa.</p>

					<p><strong>Obesity.</strong>
						<br>Binge-eating disorder is associated with overweight and obesity but has several key features that are distinct from obesity. First, levels of overvaluation of body weight and shape are higher in obese individuals with the disorder than in those without the disorder. Second, rates of psychiatric comorbidity are significantly higher among obese individuals with the disorder compared with those without the disorder. Third, the outcome of evidence-based psychological treatments for binge-eating disorder is more often successful than the treatment of obesity in individuals with comorbid obesity and binge-eating disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Bipolar and depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Increases in appetite and weight gain are included in the criteria for major depressive episode and in the atypical features specifiers for depressive and bipolar disorders. Increased eating in the context of a major depressive episode may or may not be associated with loss of control. If the full criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given. Binge eating and other symptoms of disordered eating are seen in association with bipolar disorder. If the full criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given.</p>

					<p><strong>Borderline personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Binge eating is included in the impulsive behavior criterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the full criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given.</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder<br>F50.89</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The other specified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific feeding and eating disorder. This is done by recording “other specified feeding or eating disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “bulimia nervosa of low frequency”).</p>
					<p>Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:

					</p>

					<p><strong>Note:</strong> Acute and short-term insomnia (i.e., symptoms lasting less than 3 months but otherwise meeting all criteria with regard to frequency, intensity, distress, and/or impairment) should be coded as an other specified insomnia disorder.</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normal sleep variations.</strong>
						<br>Normal sleep duration varies considerably across persons. Some individuals who require little sleep (“short sleepers”) may be concerned about their sleep duration. Short sleepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of difficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms (e.g., fatigue, concentration problems, irritability). However, some short sleepers may desire or attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an insomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia also should be distinguished from normal, age-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation attributable to inadequate opportunity or circumstance for sleep resulting, for example, from an emergency or from professional or family obligations forcing the individual to stay awake.</p>

					<p><strong>Situational/acute insomnia.</strong>
						<br>Situational/acute insomnia is a condition lasting a few days to several weeks, often associated with acute stress due to life events or with changes in sleep schedules. These acute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce significant distress and interfere with social, personal, and occupational functioning. When such symptoms are frequent enough and meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made. While the disorder often remits with subsidence of the stress or adjustment to the change in sleep schedule, some individuals will develop maladaptive patterns of thought and behavior that result in the development of a chronic insomnia disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Delayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with the delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder report sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to sleep at socially normal times, but they do not report difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising times are delayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm. This pattern is observed particularly among adolescents and younger adults. Shift work type differs from insomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work.</p>

					<p><strong>Restless legs syndrome.</strong>
						<br>Restless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant leg sensations are features that differentiate this disorder from insomnia disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Breathing-related sleep disorders.</strong>
						<br>Most individuals with a breathing-related sleep disorder have a history of loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report insomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among women and older adults.</p>

					<p><strong>Narcolepsy.</strong>
						<br>Narcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep-related hallucinations.</p>

					<p><strong>Parasomnias.</strong>
						<br>Parasomnias are characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or events during sleep that may lead to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep. However, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se, that dominate the clinical picture.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type.</strong>
						<br>Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type, is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact that a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the insomnia (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder” later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type, with onset during intoxication.</p>

						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normative variation in sleep.</strong>
						<br>“Normal” sleep duration varies considerably in the general population. “Long sleepers” (i.e., persons who require a greater than average amount of sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or automatic behavior when they obtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep. Sleep is reported to be refreshing. If social or occupational demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear. In hypersomnolence disorder, by contrast, symptoms of excessive sleepiness occur regardless of nocturnal sleep duration.<br>An inadequate amount of nocturnal sleep, or behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome, can produce symptoms of daytime sleepiness very similar to those of hypersomnolence disorder. An average sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours per night strongly suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep, yet in the United States, the average adult obtains only 6.75 hours of sleep on typical weeknights. Individuals with inadequate nocturnal sleep typically “catch up” with longer sleep durations on days when they are free from social or occupational demands or on vacations. A diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder should not be made if there is a question regarding the adequacy of nocturnal sleep duration. A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of sleep extension for 10–14 days can often clarify the diagnosis.</p>

					<p><strong>Narcolepsy.</strong>
						<br>As in hypersomnolence disorder, individuals with narcolepsy have chronic sleepiness, but several clinical and laboratory findings help distinguish the disorders. In contrast to those with hypersomnolence disorder, individuals with narcolepsy tend to sleep 7–8 hours each day and generally feel refreshed on waking in the morning. Individuals with narcolepsy generally feel more alert after a 15- to 20-minute nap, whereas those with hypersomnolence disorder tend to take longer naps, have trouble waking from naps, and do not feel alert afterward. Individuals with narcolepsy also have varying amounts of cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and fragmented nocturnal sleep, whereas cataplexy never occurs in hypersomnolence disorder and the other symptoms are uncommon. The multiple sleep latency test typically shows more than two sleep-onset REM periods in narcolepsy.</p>

					<p><strong>Fatigue as a symptom of another mental disorder or medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Hypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished from tiredness related to fatigue that may be a symptom of another mental disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder) or medical condition (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome). Unlike hypersomnolence, tiredness is not necessarily relieved by increased sleep and is unrelated to sleep quantity or quality.</p>

					<p><strong>Breathing-related sleep disorders.</strong>
						<br>Chronic sleepiness is common in breathing-related sleep disorders. Individuals with hypersomnolence and breathing-related sleep disorders may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing-related sleep disorders are suggested by a history of loud snoring, pauses in breathing during sleep, and nonrefreshing sleep. Examination often reveals obesity, a small airway, and large neck diameter. Hypertension is common, and some individuals may demonstrate signs of heart failure. Polysomnographic studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in breathing-related sleep disorder (and their absence in hypersomnolence disorder).</p>

					<p><strong>Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.</strong>
						<br>In contrast to individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, individuals with specific subtypes of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder show specific temporal patterns of symptoms. For example, individuals with delayed sleep phase type often have sleep inertia and sleepiness in the morning and feel most alert in the evening and night, with habitually late bedtimes. In contrast, those with advanced sleep phase type become sleepy and go to bed early in the evening but are alert and wake easily in the early morning.</p>

					<p><strong>Parasomnias.</strong>
						<br>Parasomnias such as non–REM sleep arousal disorders (sleepwalking/sleep terrors) or REM sleep behavior disorder rarely produce the prolonged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep or daytime sleepiness characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder. However, parasomnias such as nightmare disorder, which may result in significant curtailment of total sleep time, may conceivably manifest with daytime sleepiness.</p>

					<p><strong>Hypersomnolence in other mental disorders and medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Hypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from hypersomnolence occurring as a symptom of another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive episode, especially episodes with atypical features) or medical condition (e.g., certain cancers, multiple sclerosis). If the predominant complaint of excessive sleepiness is adequately explained by another mental disorder or medical condition, then an additional diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is not warranted. However, if the hypersomnolence is not adequately explained by a comorbid mental disorder or medical condition (e.g., the severity and nature of the hypersomnolence far exceed what would be expected with the mental disorder or medical condition), an additional diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is warranted.</p>

							<li><strong>Severe:</strong> Nearly constant sleepiness and, often, highly disturbed nocturnal sleep (which may include excessive body movement and vivid dreams). Cataplexy, when present, is drug-resistant, with multiple attacks daily.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other hypersomnias.</strong>
						<br>Hypersomnolence disorder (also known as idiopathic hypersomnia) and narcolepsy are similar with respect to the presence of chronic daytime sleepiness, age at onset (typically adolescence or early adulthood), and stable course over time, but can be distinguished based on distinctive clinical and laboratory features. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder typically have longer and less disrupted nocturnal sleep, greater difficulty awakening, more persistent daytime sleepiness (as opposed to more discrete “sleep attacks” in narcolepsy), longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and little or no dreaming during daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with NT1 generally have cataplexy. Those with NT1 or NT2 may demonstrate recurrent intrusions of elements of REM sleep into the transition between sleep and wakefulness (e.g., sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically demonstrates shorter sleep latencies (i.e., greater physiological sleepiness) as well as the presence of multiple SOREMPs in individuals with narcolepsy.</p>

					<p><strong>Sleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep.</strong>
						<br>Sleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep are common in adolescents and shift workers. In adolescents, difficulties falling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be falsely positive if conducted while the individual is sleep deprived or while his or her sleep is phase delayed.</p>

					<p><strong>Sleep apnea syndromes.</strong>
						<br>Obstructive sleep apnea is common in the general population and can be present in individuals with narcolepsy due to obesity. Because obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than narcolepsy, cataplexy may be overlooked (or absent). Narcolepsy should be considered in individuals with persistent sleepiness despite treatment of their sleep apnea.</p>

					<p><strong>Insomnia disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with narcolepsy may focus on the presence of nocturnal sleep disruption and incorrectly attribute daytime sleepiness to insomnia disorder. Although individuals with narcolepsy, like those with insomnia disorder, may experience frequent awakenings during the night, individuals with narcolepsy typically have no difficulty initiating sleep or returning to sleep in contrast to those with insomnia disorder. Moreover, insomnia disorder is not typically associated with the severity of daytime sleepiness observed in narcolepsy.</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common complaint of both individuals with major depression and individuals with narcolepsy. The presence of cataplexy (which is not a feature of major depressive disorder) along with the severity of excessive daytime sleepiness indicates a diagnosis of NT1 rather than major depressive disorder. Moreover, in individuals with major depression, MSLT results are most often normal, and there is dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness, as measured by the mean sleep latency during the MSLT. In a meta-analysis of individuals with psychiatric disorders evaluated for sleepiness, while 25% had a mean sleep latency of < 8 minutes on the MSLT, only rarely were two or more SOREMPs noted on the MSLT, highlighting the more specific REM sleep dysfunction of narcolepsy.</p>

					<p><strong>Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder; pseudocataplexy).</strong>
						<br>Individuals with functional neurological symptom disorder can present with weakness that may raise questions of cataplexy. However, in functional neurological symptom disorder, the weakness is often long- lasting, has unusual triggers, and can result in frequent falls. Individuals may report sleeping and dreaming during MSLT naps, yet the MSLT does not show the characteristic SOREMP. Home video recordings and video during sleep studies can be helpful to distinguish this condition from true cataplexy. The weakness is usually generalized in pseudocataplexy, without partial attacks. Full-blown, long-lasting pseudocataplexy may occur during consultation, allowing the examining physician enough time to verify reflexes, which remain intact. </p>

					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or other behavioral problems.</strong>
						<br>In children and adolescents, sleepiness can cause behavioral problems, including aggressiveness and inattention, leading to a misdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>

					<p><strong>Atonic seizures.</strong>
						<br>Atonic seizures, a type of seizure that causes sudden loss of muscle strength, must be distinguished from cataplexy. Atonic seizures are not commonly triggered by emotions and tend to manifest as abrupt falls rather than the slower “melting” quality of cataplexy. Atonic seizures usually occur in individuals with additional seizure types and have distinct signatures on the electroencephalogram.</p>

					<p><strong>Syncope.</strong>
						<br>Like syncope, cataplexy usually develops over several seconds, but individuals with cataplexy do not have presyncopal symptoms of dizziness, tunnel vision, and auditory changes.</p>

					<p><strong>Chorea and motor disorders.</strong>
						<br>In young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as chorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), especially in the context of a strep throat infection and high antistreptolysin O antibody levels. Some children may have an overlapping motor disorder close to onset of the cataplexy.</p>

					<p><strong>Schizophrenia.</strong>
						<br>In the presence of florid and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations, individuals with narcolepsy may think these experiences are real—a feature that suggests the presence of a true hallucination characteristic of schizophrenia. However, clear differences have been described in the pattern of hallucinatory experiences in narcolepsy compared with schizophrenia. Individuals with narcolepsy tend to report sleep-related multisensory “holistic” hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile) rather than the predominantly verbal-auditory sensory mode of individuals with schizophrenia. Moreover, high-dose stimulant treatment of individuals with narcolepsy may result in the development of persecutory delusions. If cataplexy is present with hallucinations or delusions, the first clinical supposition would be that these symptoms are secondary to narcolepsy before consideration of a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia.</p>

						<br>Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from individuals with primary snoring (i.e., otherwise asymptomatic individuals who snore and do not have abnormalities on overnight polysomnography). Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may additionally report nocturnal gasping and choking, which can be confused with the presence of asthma or gastroesophageal reflux. The presence of sleepiness or other daytime symptoms not explained by other etiologies suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, but this differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive differential diagnosis between hypersomnolence disorder, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also requires polysomnographic studies.<br>Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from other causes of sleepiness, such as narcolepsy, hypersomnolence disorder, insufficient sleep, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can be differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the presence of loud snoring, gasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime sleep episodes in narcolepsy are characteristically shorter, more refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea shows characteristic apneas and hypopneas and oxygen desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic studies. Narcolepsy results in multiple sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods during the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be associated with obesity, and some individuals have concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narcolepsy does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as the two conditions may co-occur.</p>

					<p><strong>Central sleep apnea.</strong>
						<br>Central sleep apnea can be distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea by the presence of repetitive apneas or hypopneas due to reduction or absence of respiratory effort on polysomnogram recording. Snoring may be present, although it may be less prominent than observed in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or absent altogether. Individuals with central sleep apnea often exhibit fragmented sleep and may also complain of daytime sleepiness. Central sleep apnea is seen most commonly in individuals with congestive heart failure (Cheyne-Stokes breathing) or neurological disease, or those using opioid medications.</p>

					<p><strong>Insomnia disorder.</strong>
						<br>For individuals complaining of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or early-morning awakenings, insomnia disorder can be differentiated from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the absence of snoring and the absence of the history, signs, and symptoms characteristic of the latter disorder. However, insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may coexist, and if so, both disorders may need to be addressed concurrently to improve sleep.</p>

					<p><strong>Panic attacks.</strong>
						<br>Nocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking during sleep that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. However, the lower frequency of episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of excessive sleepiness differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Polysomnography (or OCST) in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks does not reveal the typical pattern of apneas or oxygen desaturation characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea do not provide a history of daytime panic attacks.</p>

					<p><strong>Nocturnal asthma.</strong>
						<br>Nocturnal asthma can often cause sudden awakening from sleep with symptoms of gasping or choking that are indistinguishable from dyspneic episodes resulting from obstructive sleep apnea. However, a history of asthma is generally present and polysomnography (or OCST) does not find evidence of apneas, hypopneas, or oxygen desaturation indicative of obstructive apnea. Nevertheless, nocturnal asthma and obstructive sleep apnea can coexist, and this can make it difficult to determine the relative contributions of each condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children may include symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and internalizing behaviors, all of which may also be symptoms of childhood obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and signs of childhood obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar hypertrophy) would suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder may commonly co-occur, and there may be causal links between them; therefore, risk factors such as enlarged tonsils, obesity, or a family history of sleep apnea may help alert the clinician to their co-occurrence.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance/medication-induced insomnia or hypersomnia.</strong>
						<br>Substance use and substance withdrawal (including medications) can produce insomnia or hypersomnia. A careful history is usually sufficient to identify the relevant substance/medication, and follow-up shows improvement of the sleep disturbance after discontinuation of the substance/medication. In other cases, the use of a substance/medication (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates) has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. An individual with symptoms and signs consistent with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of concurrent substance use that is exacerbating the condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Other breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep disorders.</strong>
						<br>Central sleep apnea can be distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the presence of at least five central apneas per hour of sleep. These conditions may co-occur, but central sleep apnea is considered to predominate when central respiratory events are > 50% of the total number of respiratory events.<br>Cheyne-Stokes breathing can be distinguished from other mental disorders, including other sleep disorders, and other medical conditions that cause sleep fragmentation, sleepiness, and fatigue based on the presence of a predisposing condition (e.g., heart failure or stroke) and signs and polysomnographic evidence of the characteristic breathing pattern. Polysomnographic respiratory findings can help distinguish Cheyne-Stokes breathing from insomnia due to other medical conditions. For example, central sleep apnea due to high-altitude periodic breathing has a pattern that resembles Cheyne-Stokes breathing but has a shorter cycle time, occurs only at high altitude, and is not associated with heart failure.<br>Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use can be differentiated from other types of breathing-related sleep disorders based on the use of long-acting opioid medications in conjunction with polysomnographic evidence of central apneas and periodic or ataxic breathing.

It also occurs with obesity (obesity hypoventilation disorder), where it reflects a combination of increased work of breathing due to reduced chest wall compliance and ventilation-perfusion mismatch and variably reduced ventilatory drive.

					<p><strong>Other breathing-related sleep disorders.</strong>
						<br>Sleep-related hypoventilation can be distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical features and findings on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically shows more sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather than the periodic episodes seen in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea also show a pattern of discrete episodes of repeated airflow reductions that can be absent in sleep-related hypoventilation. However, both obstructive and central apneas and hypopneas can occur in association with sleep-related hypoventilation. In obesity hypoventilation, most individuals will have comorbid obstructive sleep apnea.</p>

						<br>Delayed sleep phase type must be distinguished from “normal” sleep patterns in which a person has a late schedule that does not cause personal, social, or occupational distress (most commonly seen in adolescents and young adults).</p>
					<p><strong>Other sleep disorders.</strong>
						<br>Insomnia disorder and other circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders should be included in the differential. Excessive sleepiness may also be caused by other sleep disturbances, such as breathing-related sleep disorders, insomnias, restless legs syndrome, and medical, neurological, and mental disorders. Overnight polysomnography may help in evaluating for other comorbid sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea. The circadian nature of delayed sleep phase type, however, should differentiate it from other disorders with similar complaints.</p>

					<br>
					<p style="text-align: right;">Advanced Sleep Phase Type</p>
					<p><strong>Normal variations in sleep.</strong>
						<br>Behavioral factors such as irregular sleep schedules, voluntary early awakening, and exposure to light in the early morning should be considered, particularly in older adults.</p>
					<p><strong>Other disorders that cause early-morning awakening.</strong>
						<br>Careful attention should be taken to rule out other sleep-wake disorders (e.g., insomnia disorder), other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders, bipolar disorders), and medical conditions that can cause early-morning awakening.</p>

					<br>
					<p style="text-align: right;">Irregular Sleep-Wake Type</p>

						<br>Irregular sleep-wake type should be distinguished from a voluntary irregular sleep-wake schedule and poor sleep hygiene, which can result in insomnia and excessive sleepiness.</p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions and mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Other causes of insomnia and daytime sleepiness, including comorbid medical conditions and mental disorders or medication, should be considered.</p>

					<br>
					<p style="text-align: right;">Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type</p>
					<p><strong>Other circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.</strong>
						<br>In sighted individuals, non-24-hour sleep-wake type should be differentiated from delayed sleep phase type, as individuals with delayed sleep phase type may display a similar progressive delay in sleep period for several days.</p>
					<p><strong>Depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Depressive disorders may result in similar circadian dysregulation and symptoms.</p>

					<br>
					<p style="text-align: right;">Shift Work Type</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Nightmare disorder.</strong>
						<br>In contrast to individuals with NREM sleep arousal disorders, individuals with nightmare disorder typically awaken easily and completely, report vivid storylike dreams accompanying the episodes, and tend to have episodes later in the night. NREM sleep arousal disorders occur during NREM sleep, whereas nightmares usually occur during REM sleep. Parents of children with NREM sleep arousal disorders may misinterpret reports of fragmentary imagery as nightmares.</p>

					<p><strong>Breathing-related sleep disorders.</strong>
						<br>Breathing disorders during sleep can also produce confusional arousals with subsequent amnesia. However, breathing-related sleep disorders are also characterized by symptoms of snoring, breathing pauses, and daytime sleepiness. In some individuals, a breathing-related sleep disorder may precipitate episodes of sleepwalking.</p>

					<p><strong>REM sleep behavior disorder.</strong>
						<br>REM sleep behavior disorder may be difficult to distinguish from NREM sleep arousal disorders. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by episodes of prominent, complex movements, often involving personal injury arising from sleep. In contrast to NREM sleep arousal disorders, REM sleep behavior disorder occurs during REM sleep. Individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder may be awakened easily during an episode and report more detailed and vivid dream content than do individuals with NREM sleep arousal disorders. These individuals and/or their bed partners often report that they “act out dreams.”</p>

					<p><strong>Parasomnia overlap syndrome.</strong>
						<br>Parasomnia overlap syndrome consists of clinical and polysomnographic features of both sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Sleep-related seizures.</strong>
						<br>Some types of seizures can produce episodes of very unusual behaviors that occur predominantly or exclusively during sleep. Nocturnal seizures may closely mimic NREM sleep arousal disorders but tend to be more stereotypic in nature, occur multiple times nightly, and be more likely to occur from daytime naps. In addition, seizures may arise from wakefulness, which does not occur with NREM sleep arousal disorders. The presence of sleep- related seizures does not preclude the presence of NREM sleep arousal disorders. When recurrent, sleep-related seizures are considered to be a form of epilepsy.</p>

					<p><strong>Alcohol-induced blackouts.</strong>
						<br>Alcohol-induced blackouts may be associated with extremely complex behaviors in the absence of other suggestions of intoxication. They do not involve the loss of consciousness but rather reflect an isolated disruption of memory for events during a drinking episode. By history, these behaviors may be indistinguishable from those seen in NREM sleep arousal disorders.</p>

					<p><strong>Dissociative amnesia, with dissociative fugue.</strong>
						<br>Dissociative fugue may be extremely difficult to distinguish from sleepwalking. Unlike all other parasomnias, nocturnal dissociative fugue arises from a period of wakefulness during sleep, rather than precipitously from sleep without intervening wakefulness. A history of recurrent childhood physical or sexual abuse is usually present (but may be difficult to obtain).</p>

					<p><strong>Malingering or other voluntary behavior.</strong>
						<br>As with dissociative fugue, malingering or other voluntary behavior occurs during wakefulness.</p>

					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Panic attacks may also cause abrupt awakenings from deep NREM sleep accompanied by fearfulness, but these episodes produce rapid and complete awakening without the confusion, amnesia, or motor activity typical of NREM sleep arousal disorders.</p>

					<p><strong>Medication-induced complex behaviors.</strong>
						<br>Behaviors similar to those in NREM sleep arousal disorders can be induced by use of, or withdrawal from, substances or medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, opiates, cocaine, nicotine, antipsychotics or other dopamine receptor–blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, chloral hydrate). Such behaviors may arise from the sleep period and may be extremely complex. The underlying pathophysiology appears to be a relatively isolated amnesia. In such cases, substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, parasomnia type, should be diagnosed (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder” later in this chapter).</p>

					<p><strong>Night eating syndrome.</strong>
						<br>In contrast to the sleep-related eating form of sleepwalking, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating during incomplete arousals from sleep, night eating syndrome is considered to be an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing, with a normal circadian timing of sleep onset in which the individual wakes up in the middle of the night and overeats.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Sleep terror disorder.</strong>
						<br>Both nightmare disorder and sleep terror disorder include awakenings or partial awakenings with fearfulness and autonomic activation, but the two disorders can be readily differentiated. Nightmares typically occur later in the night, during REM sleep, and produce vivid, story-like, and clearly recalled dreams; mild autonomic arousal; and complete awakenings. Sleep terrors typically arise in the first third of the night during deep NREM sleep (especially during stage 3 sleep, now called N3 sleep) and produce either no dream recall or images without an elaborate story-like quality. Sleep terrors are thought to be caused by partial awakenings intermixed with persisting sleep, with clinical manifestations of confusion, disorientation, and only partial responsiveness, and often with substantial autonomic arousal. There is usually amnesia for the event in the morning.</p>

					<p><strong>REM sleep behavior disorder.</strong>
						<br>The presence of complex vocal and motor activity during frightening dreams should prompt further evaluation for REM sleep behavior disorder, which occurs more typically among late middle- and older-age men but may also affect women. Although nightmares are typically characteristic of REM sleep behavior disorder, unlike nightmare disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with dream enactment that may cause nocturnal injuries. If the nightmares precede REM sleep behavior disorder and warrant independent clinical attention, an additional diagnosis of nightmare disorder may be given.</p>

					<p><strong>Bereavement.</strong>
						<br>Dysphoric dreams may occur during bereavement but typically involve loss and sadness and are followed by self-reflection and insight, rather than distress, on awakening.</p>

					<p><strong>PTSD or acute stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Nightmares in which the content or affect of the dream is related to a traumatic event may be a component of PTSD or acute stress disorder. An additional diagnosis of nightmare disorder may be warranted if the severity or frequency of the nightmares necessitates independent clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Narcolepsy.</strong>
						<br>Nightmares are a frequent complaint in narcolepsy, but the presence of excessive sleepiness, with or without cataplexy, differentiates this condition from nightmare disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Sleep-related seizures.</strong>
						<br>Nocturnal seizures usually involve stereotyped motor activity. Associated nightmares, if recalled, are often also repetitively stereotyped in nature or reflect epileptogenic features such as the content of diurnal auras, phosphenes (visual sensations in the absence of light input), or ictal imagery.</p>

					<p><strong>Breathing-related sleep disorders.</strong>
						<br>Breathing-related sleep disorders can lead to awakenings with autonomic arousal, but these are not usually accompanied by recall of nightmares.</p>

					<p><strong>Panic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Panic attacks arising during sleep can produce abrupt awakenings with autonomic arousal and fearfulness, but nightmares are typically not reported and symptoms are similar to panic attacks arising during wakefulness.</p>

					<p><strong>Sleep-related dissociative disorders.</strong>
						<br>Individuals may recall actual physical or emotional trauma as a “dream” during electroencephalography-documented awakenings.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance or medication use.</strong>
						<br>Numerous substances/medications can precipitate nightmares, including dopaminergic drugs; β-adrenergic antagonists and other antihypertensives; amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, and other stimulants; antidepressants; smoking cessation aids; and melatonin. Withdrawal of REM sleep–suppressant medications (e.g., antidepressants) and alcohol can produce REM sleep rebound accompanied by nightmares. If nightmares are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder should be considered.</p>

					<p><strong>Other parasomnias.</strong>
						<br>Confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can easily be confused with REM sleep behavior disorder. In general, these disorders occur in individuals younger than 50 years. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder, they arise from NREM sleep and therefore tend to occur in the early portion of the sleep period. Awakening from a confusional arousal is associated with confusion, disorientation, and incomplete recall of dream mentation accompanying the behavior. Polysomnographic monitoring in the disorders of arousal generally reveals normal REM sleep atonia unless there is a comorbid parasomnia.</p>

					<p><strong>Medication-induced sleep disorder, parasomnia type.</strong>
						<br>Many widely prescribed medications, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, may result in polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep without atonia and in frank REM sleep behavior disorder, which is diagnosed as a medication-induced sleep disorder, parasomnia type. It is not known whether the medications per se result in REM sleep without atonia and/or REM sleep behavior disorder, or whether they unmask an underlying predisposition.</p>

					<p><strong>Asymptomatic REM sleep without atonia.</strong>
						<br>Clinical dream-enacting behaviors coupled with the polysomnographic finding of REM sleep without atonia is necessary for the diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder. REM sleep without atonia without a clinical history of dream-enacting behaviors is simply an asymptomatic polysomnographic observation with an as yet unknown clinical significance.</p>

					<p><strong>Nocturnal seizures.</strong>
						<br>Nocturnal seizures may mimic REM sleep behavior disorder, but the behaviors characteristic of nocturnal seizures are generally stereotyped. Polysomnographic monitoring employing a full electroencephalographic seizure montage may differentiate the two. REM sleep without atonia is generally not present on polysomnographic monitoring in individuals with epilepsy.</p>

					<p><strong>Obstructive sleep apnea.</strong>
						<br>Obstructive sleep apnea may result in vocalizations and motor behaviors that very closely resemble REM sleep behavior disorder, such as talking, shouting, gesturing, and punching, along with unpleasant dreams. Polysomnographic monitoring is necessary to differentiate between these two disorders. In REM sleep behavior disorder, the parasomnia symptoms occur during periods of REM sleep without atonia. In obstructive sleep apnea, the parasomnia symptoms only occur during arousals at the end of the obstructive sleep apneic events and resolve following effective treatment of the obstructive sleep apnea (continuous positive airway pressure). REM sleep without atonia is not typically observed in obstructive sleep apnea.</p>

					<p><strong>Other specified dissociative disorder (sleep-related psychogenic dissociative disorder).</strong>
						<br>Unlike virtually all other parasomnias, which arise precipitously from NREM or REM sleep, psychogenic dissociative behaviors arise from a period of well-defined wakefulness during the sleep period. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder, this condition is more prevalent in young women.</p>

					<p><strong>Malingering.</strong>
						<br>Many cases of malingering in which the individual reports problematic sleep movements mimic the clinical features of REM sleep behavior disorder, and polysomnographic documentation is mandatory.</p>

					<h3>Restless Legs Syndrome<br>G25.81</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by or in response to uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs, characterized by all of the following:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>The urge to move the legs begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity.</li>
							<li>The urge to move the legs is partially or totally relieved by movement.</li>
							<li>The urge to move the legs is worse in the evening or at night than during the day, or occurs only in the evening or at night.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The symptoms in Criterion A occur at least three times per week and have persisted for at least 3 months.</li>
						<li>The symptoms in Criterion A are accompanied by significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The symptoms in Criterion A are not attributable to another mental disorder or medical condition (e.g., arthritis, leg edema, peripheral ischemia, leg cramps) and are not better explained by a behavioral condition (e.g., positional discomfort, habitual foot tapping).</li>
						<li>The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse or medication (e.g., akathisia).</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>The most important conditions in the differential diagnosis of RLS are leg cramps, positional discomfort, arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg edema, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping. Muscle cramps, relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness to palpation (myalgias), and other abnormalities on physical examination are not characteristic of RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not typically manifest with the desire to move the limbs nor are there frequent limb movements. Less common conditions to be differentiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia, myelopathy, symptomatic venous insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, eczema, other orthopedic problems, and anxiety-induced restlessness. Worsening at night and periodic limb movements are more common in RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy.<br>While it is important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another medical or behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of these similar conditions can occur in an individual with RLS. This necessitates a separate focus on each possible condition in the diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the diagnosis of RLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features of RLS, particularly PLMS or a family history of RLS, may be helpful. Clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic agent and positive family history for RLS, can help with the differential diagnosis.</p>

					<h3>Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder</h3>

						</ul>
						<li>The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.</li>
						<li>The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Note:</strong> This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced sleep disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sleep disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sleep disorder. There are two exceptions to this coding convention as it applies to caffeine- and tobacco-induced sleep disorders. Because caffeine use disorder is not an official DSM-5 category, there is only a single ICD-10-CM code for caffeine-induced sleep disorder: F15.982. Moreover, because ICD-10-CM assumes that tobacco-induced sleep disorder can only occur in the context of moderate or severe tobacco use disorder, the ICD-10- CM code for tobacco-induced sleep disorder is F17.208.</p>

					</p>

					<br><br><br>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal.</strong>
						<br>Sleep disturbances are commonly encountered in the context of substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the sleep disturbance is predominant in the clinical picture and is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.</p>
					<p><strong>Delirium.</strong>
						<br>If the substance/medication-induced sleep disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium, it is not diagnosed separately.</p>
					<p><strong>Other sleep disorders.</strong>
						<br>A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished from another sleep disorder if a substance/medication is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms. A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder attributed to a prescribed medication for a mental disorder or medical condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the medication or during discontinuation, if there is a discontinuation/withdrawal syndrome associated with the medication. Once treatment is discontinued, the sleep disturbance will usually remit within days to several weeks. If symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks, other causes for the sleep disturbance–related symptoms should be considered. Not infrequently, individuals with another sleep disorder use medications or drugs of abuse to self-medicate their symptoms (e.g., alcohol for management of insomnia). If the substance/medication is judged to play a significant role in the exacerbation of the sleep disturbance, an additional diagnosis of a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder may be warranted.</p>
					<p><strong>Sleep disorder associated with medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder and sleep disorders with a medical condition (i.e., insomnia disorder, hypersomnolence disorder, and nightmare disorder) may produce similar symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, or nightmares, respectively. Many medical conditions that cause sleep disturbance are treated with medications that may also cause sleep disturbances. The chronology of symptoms is the most important factor in distinguishing between these two sources of sleep symptoms. Difficulties with sleep in an individual with a comorbid medical condition that clearly preceded the use of any medication for treatment of that medical condition would suggest a diagnosis of insomnia disorder, hypersomnolence disorder, or nightmare disorder with the specifier “with [specific medical condition]” applicable to the diagnosis. Conversely, sleep symptoms that appear only after the initiation of a particular substance/medication suggest a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. If the sleep disturbance is comorbid with another medical condition and is also exacerbated by substance use, both diagnoses are given (i.e., insomnia disorder, hypersomnolence disorder, or nightmare disorder, “with [specific medical condition]” respectively; and [specific substance/medication]-induced sleep disorder). When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the sleep disturbance is attributable to a substance/medication or a medical condition, or independent (i.e., not attributable to either a substance/medication or a medical condition), a diagnosis of unspecified sleep-wake disorder is indicated.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Another medical condition or injury and/or its treatment.</strong>
						<br>A major diagnostic challenge is differentiating between a delayed ejaculation that is fully explained by another medical condition or injury (or its treatment) and a delayed ejaculation attributable to a variety of proportionally different biomedical-psychosocial and cultural factors that determine the symptom(s). A number of medical conditions or injuries, along with their treatments, may produce delays in ejaculation independent of psychosocial and cultural issues. <br>Delayed ejaculation must be differentiated from a number of urological conditions (especially other ejaculatory disorders), including retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation, which is typically the result of etiologies ranging from hormonal to neurological and/or anatomical abnormalities, including ejaculatory duct obstruction and other urological disorders.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance/medicationuse.</strong>
						<br>A number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, α sympathetic drugs, alcohol, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory problems. In such cases, the diagnosis is substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction instead of delayed ejaculation.</p>
					<p><strong>Dysfunction with orgasm.</strong>
						<br>It is important in the history to ascertain whether the complaint concerns delayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs in the genitals, whereas the experience of orgasm is believed to be primarily subjective. Ejaculation and orgasm usually occur together but not always. For example, a male with a normal ejaculatory pattern may complain of decreased pleasure (i.e., anhedonic ejaculation). Such a complaint would not be coded as delayed ejaculation but could be coded as other specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Nonsexual mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Major depressive disorder and erectile disorder are closely associated, and erectile disorder accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur. If the erectile difficulties are better explained by another mental disorder, such as major depression, then a diagnosis of erectile disorder would not be made.</p>
					<p><strong>Normal erectile function.</strong>

					<p><strong>Substance/medication use.</strong>

					<p><strong>Another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erectile disorder is ruling out erectile problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such cases would not receive a diagnosis of a mental disorder. The distinction between erectile disorder as a mental disorder and erectile dysfunction as the result of another medical condition is usually unclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive biological and psychiatric etiologies. If the individual is older than 40–50 years and/or has concomitant medical problems, the differential diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially vascular disease. The presence of an organic disease known to cause erectile problems does not confirm a causal relationship. For example, a male with diabetes mellitus can develop erectile disorder in response to psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to organic factors is generalized and gradual in onset. An exception would be erectile problems after traumatic injury to the nervous innervation of the genital organs (e.g., spinal cord injury). Erectile problems that are situational and inconsistent and that have an acute onset after a stressful life event are most often attributable to psychological events. An age younger than 40 years is also suggestive of a psychological etiology to the difficulty.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Nonsexual mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, in which there is “markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day,” may explain the lack of sexual interest/arousal. If the lack of interest or arousal is completely attributable to another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance/medication use.</strong>
						<br>An onset of difficulties in desire or arousal that coincides with the beginning of substance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the substance/medication or dose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, which should be diagnosed instead of female sexual interest/arousal disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>If the sexual symptoms are considered to be almost exclusively associated with the effects of another medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus, endothelial disease, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.</p>

					<p><strong>Interpersonal factors.</strong>
						<br>If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, explain the sexual interest/arousal symptoms, then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.</p>

					<p><strong>Other sexual dysfunctions.</strong>
						<br>The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. It is common for women to experience more than one sexual dysfunction. For example, the presence of chronic genital pain may lead to a lack of desire for the (painful) sexual activity. Lack of interest and arousal during sexual activity may impair orgasmic ability. For some women, all aspects of the sexual response may be unsatisfying and distressing.</p>

					<p><strong>Inadequate or absent sexual stimuli.</strong>
						<br>When differential diagnoses are being considered, it is important to assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman’s sexual experience. In cases where inadequate or absent sexual stimuli are contributing to the clinical picture, there may be evidence for clinical care, but a sexual dysfunction diagnosis would not be made. Similarly, transient and adaptive alterations in sexual functioning that are secondary to a significant life or personal event must be considered in the differential diagnosis.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Another medical condition. </strong>
						<br>In many instances, females with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder will also be diagnosed with another medical condition (e.g., lichen sclerosus, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, genitourinary syndrome of menopause). In some cases, treating the medical condition may alleviate the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Much of the time, this is not the case. There are no reliable tools or diagnostic methods to allow clinicians to know whether the medical condition or genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is primary. Often, the associated medical conditions are difficult to diagnose and treat. For example, the increased incidence of postmenopausal pain during intercourse may sometimes be attributable to vaginal dryness or irritation associated with declining estrogen levels. The relationship, however, between genital symptoms, estrogen, and pain is not well understood.</p>

					<p><strong>Somatic symptom and related disorders.</strong>
						<br>Some females with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may also be diagnosable with somatic symptom disorder. Since both genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and the somatic symptom and related disorders are new diagnoses in DSM-5, it is not yet clear whether they can be reliably differentiated. Some females diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder will also be diagnosed with a specific phobia.</p>

					<p><strong>Inadequate sexual stimuli.</strong>
						<br>It is important that the clinician, in considering differential diagnoses, assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the female’s sexual experience. Sexual situations in which there is inadequate foreplay or arousal may lead to difficulties in penetration, pain, or avoidance. Erectile dysfunction or premature (early) ejaculation in the male partner may result in difficulties with penetration. These conditions should be carefully assessed. In some situations, a diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may not be appropriate.

					<p><strong>Another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>If the low/absent desire and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or fantasies are better explained by the effects of another medical condition (e.g., hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.</p>

In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance- induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sexual dysfunction.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunctions.</strong>
						<br>Many mental disorders, such as depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, are associated with disturbances of sexual function. Thus, differentiating a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction from a manifestation of the underlying mental disorder can be quite difficult. The diagnosis is usually established if a close relationship between substance/medication initiation or discontinuation is observed. A clear diagnosis can be established if the problem occurs after substance/medication initiation, dissipates with substance/medication discontinuation, and recurs with introduction of the same agent. Most substance/medication-induced side effects occur shortly after initiation or discontinuation. Sexual side effects that only occur after chronic use of a substance/medication may be extremely difficult to diagnose with certainty.</p>

						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Nonconformity to gender roles.</strong>
						<br>Gender dysphoria should be distinguished from simple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of another gender than the assigned one and by the extent and pervasiveness of gender-variant activities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to merely describe nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., “tomboyism” in girls, “girly-boy” behavior in boys, occasional cross-dressing in adult men). Given the increased openness of gender-diverse expressions by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it is important that the clinical diagnosis be limited to those individuals whose distress and impairment meet the specified criteria.</p>

					<p><strong>Transvestic disorder.</strong>
						<br>Transvestic disorder is diagnosed in heterosexual (or bisexual) adolescent and adult males (rarely in females) for whom women’s clothing generates sexual excitement and causes distress and/or impairment without drawing their assigned gender into question. It is occasionally accompanied by gender dysphoria. An individual with transvestic disorder who also has clinically significant gender dysphoria can be given both diagnoses. In some cases of postpubertal-onset gender dysphoria in individuals assigned male at birth who are attracted to women, cross-dressing with sexual excitement is a precursor to the diagnosis of gender dysphoria.</p>

					<p><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder.</strong>
						<br>An individual with body dysmorphic disorder focuses on the alteration or removal of a specific body part because it is perceived as abnormally formed, not because it represents a repudiated assigned gender. When an individual’s presentation meets criteria for both gender dysphoria and body dysmorphic disorder, both diagnoses can be given. Individuals wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed by some body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more “complete” usually do not wish to change gender, but rather desire to live as an amputee or a disabled person.</p>

					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>In individuals with autism spectrum disorder, diagnosing gender dysphoria can be challenging. It can be difficult to differentiate potential co-occurring gender dysphoria from an autistic preoccupation because of the concrete and rigid thinking around gender roles and/or poor understanding of social relationships characteristic of autism spectrum disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>In schizophrenia, there may rarely be delusions of belonging to some other gender. In the absence of psychotic symptoms, insistence by an individual with gender dysphoria that he or she is another gender is not considered a delusion. Schizophrenia (or other psychotic disorders) and gender dysphoria may co-occur. Gender- themed delusions may occur in up to 20% of individuals with schizophrenia. They can usually be differentiated from gender dysphoria by their bizarre content and by waxing and waning with remissions and exacerbations of psychotic episodes.</p>

					<p><strong>Other clinical presentations.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals with an emasculinization desire who develop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity do have a presentation that meets criteria for gender dysphoria. However, some males seek genital surgery for either aesthetic reasons or to remove psychological effects of androgens without changing male identity; in these cases, the criteria for gender dysphoria are not met.</p>

						</ul></p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Conduct disorder.</strong>
						<br>Conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related to conduct problems that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other authority figures (e.g., teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder are typically of a less severe nature than those of conduct disorder and do not include aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. However, evidence suggests that oppositional defiant disorder is associated with equivalent or even greater levels of impairment than conduct disorder. Furthermore, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotion dysregulation (i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not included in the definition of conduct disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Adjustment disorder.</strong>
						<br>Environmental and family stressors may be associated with externalizing manifestations of emotion dysregulation. In children, these may manifest as tantrums and oppositional behavior; and in adolescents, as aggressive behaviors (e.g., rebellion and defiance). Temporal association with a stressor and symptom duration of less than 6 months after the resolution of the stressor may help distinguish adjustment disorder from oppositional defiant disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>In children younger than 6 years, posttraumatic stress disorder may manifest initially as dysregulated behaviors, opposition, and tantrums; the association with a traumatic event and with other specific symptoms (traumatic play) are key to establishing the diagnosis. In adolescents, traumatic reenactment and risk-taking may be misinterpreted as defiance and opposition or as conduct problems.</p>

					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>ADHD is often comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder. To make the additional diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, it is important to determine that the individual’s failure to conform to requests of others is not solely in situations that demand sustained effort and attention or demand that the individual sit still.</p>

					<p><strong>Depressive and bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>Depressive and bipolar disorders often involve negative affect and irritability. As a result, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be made if the symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a mood disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.</strong>
						<br>Oppositional defiant disorder shares with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder the symptoms of chronic irritable mood and temper outbursts. However, if the irritable mood and other symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is not given, even if all criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are met.</p>

					<p><strong>Intermittent explosive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Intermittent explosive disorder also involves high rates of anger. However, individuals with this disorder show serious aggression toward others that is not part of the definition of oppositional defiant disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).</strong>
						<br>In individuals with intellectual developmental disorder, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is given only if the oppositional behavior is markedly greater than is commonly observed among individuals of comparable mental age and with comparable severity of intellectual disability.</p>

					<p><strong>Language disorder.</strong>
						<br>Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from a failure to follow directions that is the result of impaired language comprehension (e.g., hearing loss).</p>

					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from defiance because of fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety disorder.

					<h3>Intermittent Explosive Disorder<br>F63.81</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses as manifested by either of the following:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights) or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression does not result in damage or destruction of property and does not result in physical injury to animals or other individuals.</li>
							<li>Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals occurring within a 12-month period.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors.</li>
						<li>The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and/or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intimidation).</li>
						<li>The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with financial or legal consequences.</li>
						<li>Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmental level).</li>
						<li>The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alzheimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part of an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Note:</strong> This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen in these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.</p>


					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when Criteria A1 and/or A2 are only met during an episode of another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder), or when impulsive aggressive outbursts are attributable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance or medication. This diagnosis also should not be made, particularly in children and adolescents ages 6–18 years, when the impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.</strong>
						<br>In contrast to intermittent explosive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by a persistently negative mood state (i.e., irritability, anger) most of the day, nearly every day, between impulsive aggressive outbursts. A diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can only be given when the onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts is before age 10 years. Finally, a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be made for the first time after age 18 years. Otherwise, these diagnoses are mutually exclusive.</p>

					<p><strong>Antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder often display recurrent, problematic impulsive aggressive outbursts. However, the level of impulsive aggression in individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder is lower than that in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, and personality change due to another medical condition, aggressive type.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when aggressive outbursts are judged to result from the physiological effects of another diagnosable medical condition (e.g., brain injury associated with a change in personality characterized by aggressive outbursts; complex partial epilepsy). Nonspecific abnormalities on neurological examination (e.g., “soft signs”) and nonspecific electroencephalographic changes are compatible with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder unless there is a diagnosable medical condition that better explains the impulsive aggressive outbursts.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when impulsive aggressive outbursts are nearly always associated with intoxication with or withdrawal from substances (e.g., alcohol, phencyclidine, cocaine and other stimulants, barbiturates, inhalants). However, when a sufficient number of impulsive aggressive outbursts also occur in the absence of substance intoxication or withdrawal, and these warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given.</p>

					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with any of these childhood-onset disorders may exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. Individuals with ADHD are typically impulsive and, as a result, may also exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. While individuals with conduct disorder can exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts, the form of aggression characterized by the diagnostic criteria is proactive and predatory. Aggression in oppositional defiant disorder is typically characterized by temper tantrums and verbal arguments with authority figures, whereas impulsive aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder are in response to a broader array of provocation and include physical assault. The level of impulsive aggression in individuals with a history of one or more of these disorders has been reported as lower than that in comparable individuals whose symptoms also meet intermittent explosive disorder Criteria A through E. Accordingly, if Criteria A through E are also met, and the impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given.</p>

These characteristics reflect the individual’s typical pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning over this period and not just occasional occurrences in some situations. Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier, multiple information sources are necessary. In addition to the individual’s self-report, it is necessary to consider reports by others who have known the individual for extended periods of time (e.g., parents, teachers, co-workers, extended family members, peers).</p>
							<ul class="specifier">
								<li><strong>Lack of remorse or guilt:</strong> Does not feel bad or guilty when he or she does something wrong (exclude remorse when expressed only when caught and/or facing punishment).

								<li><strong>Callous—lack of empathy:</strong> Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings of others. The individual is described as cold and uncaring. The individual appears more concerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or herself, rather than their effects on others, even when they result in substantial harm to others.</li>
								<li><strong>Unconcerned about performance:</strong> Does not show concern about poor/problematic performance at school, at work, or in other important activities. The individual does not put forth the effort necessary to perform well, even when expectations are clear, and typically blames others for his or her poor performance.</li>
								<li><strong>Shallow or deficient affect:</strong> Does not express feelings or show emotions to others, except in ways that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions contradict the emotion displayed; can turn emotions “on” or “off” quickly) or when emotional expressions are used for gain (e.g., emotions displayed to manipulate or intimidate others).</li>

							<li><strong>Severe:</strong> Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, or conduct problems cause considerable harm to others (e.g., forced sex, physical cruelty, use of a weapon, stealing while confronting a victim, breaking and entering).</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Oppositional defiant disorder.</strong>
						<br>Conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related to symptoms that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other authority figures (e.g., parents, teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder are typically of a less severe nature than those of individuals with conduct disorder and do not include aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Furthermore, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotion dysregulation (i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not included in the definition of conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, both diagnoses can be given.</p>

					<p><strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</strong>
						<br>Although children with ADHD often exhibit hyperactive and impulsive behavior that may be disruptive, this behavior does not by itself violate societal norms or the rights of others and therefore does not usually meet criteria for conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both ADHD and conduct disorder, both diagnoses should be given.</p>

					<p><strong>Depressive and bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>Irritability, aggression, and conduct problems can occur in children or adolescents with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The behavioral problems associated with these mood disorders can usually be distinguished from the pattern of conduct problems seen in conduct disorder based on their course. Specifically, individuals with conduct disorder will display substantial levels of aggressive or nonaggressive conduct problems during periods in which there is no mood disturbance, either historically (i.e., a history of conduct problems predating the onset of the mood disturbance) or concurrently (i.e., display of some conduct problems that are premeditated and do not occur during periods of intense emotional arousal). In those cases in which criteria for conduct disorder and a mood disorder are met, both diagnoses can be given.</p>

					<p><strong>Intermittent explosive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Both conduct disorder and intermittent explosive disorder involve high rates of aggression. However, the aggression in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder is limited to impulsive aggression and is not premeditated, and it is not committed in order to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intimidation). Also, the definition of intermittent explosive disorder does not include the non-aggressive symptoms of conduct disorder. If criteria for both disorders are met, the diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should be given only when the recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Adjustment disorders.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder (with disturbance of conduct or with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct) should be considered if clinically significant conduct problems that do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder develop in clear association with the onset of a psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within 6 months of the termination of the stressor (or its consequences). Conduct disorder is diagnosed only when the conduct problems represent a repetitive and persistent pattern that is associated with impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.</p>

					<h3>Pyromania<br>F63.1</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion.</li>
						<li>Tension or affective arousal before the act.</li>
						<li>Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, consequences).</li>
						<li>Pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or when witnessing or participating in their aftermath.</li>
						<li>The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve one’s living circumstances, in response to a delusion or hallucination, or as a result of impaired judgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder [intellectual disability], substance intoxication).</li>
						<li>The fire setting is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder.</li>
					</ul>


					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other causes of intentional fire setting.</strong>
						<br>It is important to rule out other causes of fire setting before giving the diagnosis of pyromania. Intentional fire setting may occur for profit, sabotage, or revenge; to conceal a crime; to make a political statement (e.g., an act of terrorism or protest); or to attract attention or recognition (e.g., setting a fire in order to discover it and save the day). Fire setting may also occur as part of developmental experimentation in childhood (e.g., playing with matches, lighters, or fire).</p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire setting occurs as part of conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder, or if it occurs in response to a delusion or a hallucination (e.g., in schizophrenia) or is attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g., epilepsy). The diagnosis of pyromania should also not be given when fire setting results from impaired judgment associated with major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, or substance intoxication.</p>

						<li>Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft.</li>
						<li>Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft.</li>
						<li>The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is not in response to a delusion or a hallucination.</li>
						<li>The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder.</li>
					</ul>


					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Ordinary theft.</strong>
						<br>Kleptomania should be distinguished from ordinary acts of theft or shoplifting. Ordinary theft (whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate and is motivated by the usefulness of the object or its monetary worth. Some persons, especially adolescents, may also steal on a dare, as an act of rebellion, or as a rite of passage. The diagnosis is not made unless other characteristic features of kleptomania are also present. Kleptomania is rare, whereas shoplifting is relatively common.</p>

					<p><strong>Malingering.</strong>
						<br>In malingering, individuals may simulate the symptoms of kleptomania to avoid criminal prosecution.</p>

					<p><strong>Antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder.</strong>
						<br>Antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder are distinguished from kleptomania by a general pattern of antisocial behavior.</p>

					<p><strong>Manic episodes, psychotic episodes, and major neurocognitive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Kleptomania should be distinguished from intentional or inadvertent stealing that may occur during a manic episode, in response to delusions or hallucinations (e.g., in schizophrenia), or as a result of a major neurocognitive disorder.</p>

					</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Nonpathological use of alcohol.</strong>
						<br>The key element of alcohol use disorder is the use of heavy doses of alcohol with resulting repeated and significant distress or impaired functioning. While most drinkers sometimes consume enough alcohol to feel intoxicated, only a minority (< 20%) ever develop alcohol use disorder. Therefore, drinking, even daily, in low doses and occasional intoxication do not by themselves make this diagnosis.</p>

					<p><strong>Alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, and alcohol-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Alcohol use disorder is differentiated from alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, and alcohol induced mental disorders (e.g., alcohol-induced depressive disorder) in that alcohol use disorder describes a problematic pattern of alcohol use that involves impaired control over alcohol use, social impairment due to alcohol use, risky alcohol use (e.g., driving while intoxicated), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance or withdrawal), whereas alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, and alcohol-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric syndromes that develop in the context of heavy use. Alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, and alcohol-induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with alcohol use disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or an alcohol-induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, the presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.</p>

					<p><strong>Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.</strong>
						<br>The signs and symptoms of alcohol use disorder are similar to those seen in sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. The two must be distinguished, however, because the course may be different, especially in relation to medical problems.</p>

					<p><strong>Conduct disorder in childhood and antisocial personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Alcohol use disorder, along with other substance use disorders, is seen in the majority of individuals with antisocial personality disorder and preexisting conduct disorder. Because these diagnoses are associated with an early onset of alcohol use disorder as well as a worse prognosis, it is important to establish both conditions.</p>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there is a comorbid alcohol use disorder. If a mild alcohol use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is <strong>F10.120</strong>, and if a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10- CM code is <strong>F10.220</strong>. If there is no comorbid alcohol use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is <strong>F10.920</strong>.</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Several medical (e.g., diabetic acidosis) and neurological conditions (e.g., cerebellar ataxia, multiple sclerosis) can temporarily resemble alcohol intoxication.</p>

					<p><strong>Alcohol-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Alcohol intoxication is distinguished from alcohol-induced mental disorders (e.g., alcohol-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication) because the symptoms (e.g., depressed mood) in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with alcohol intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication.</strong>
						<br>Intoxication with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs or with other sedating substances (e.g., antihistamines, anticholinergic drugs) can be mistaken for alcohol intoxication. The differential requires observing alcohol on the breath, measuring blood or breath alcohol levels, ordering a medical workup, and gathering a good history. The signs and symptoms of sedative-hypnotic intoxication are very similar to those observed with alcohol and include similar problematic behavioral or psychological changes. These changes are accompanied by evidence of impaired functioning and judgment—which, if intense, can result in a life-threatening coma—and levels of incoordination that can interfere with driving abilities and with performing usual activities. However, there is no smell as there is with alcohol, but there is likely to be evidence of misuse of the depressant drug in the blood or urine toxicology analyses.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Independent mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Caffeine intoxication may be characterized by symptoms (e.g., panic attacks) that resemble independent mental disorders. To meet criteria for caffeine intoxication, the symptoms must not be associated with another medical condition or another mental disorder, such as an anxiety disorder, that could better explain them. Manic episodes; panic disorder; generalized anxiety disorder; amphetamine intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal or tobacco withdrawal; sleep disorders; and medication-induced side effects (e.g., akathisia) can cause a clinical picture that is similar to that of caffeine intoxication.</p>
					<p><strong>Caffeine-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>The temporal relationship of the symptoms to increased caffeine use or to abstinence from caffeine helps to establish the diagnosis. Caffeine intoxication is differentiated from caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication (see “Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder” in the chapter “Anxiety Disorders”), and caffeine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication (see “Substance/Medication- Induced Sleep Disorder” in the chapter “Sleep-Wake Disorders”), because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety and insomnia, respectively) in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with caffeine intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions and medication side effects.</strong>
						<br>Caffeine withdrawal can mimic migraine and other headache disorders, viral illnesses, sinus conditions, tension, other drug withdrawal states (e.g., from amphetamines, cocaine), and medication side effects. The final determination of caffeine withdrawal should rest on a determination of the pattern and amount consumed, the time interval between caffeine abstinence and onset of symptoms, and the particular clinical features presented by the individual. A challenge dose of caffeine followed by symptom remission may be used to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
					<p><strong>Caffeine-induced sleep disorder.</strong>
						<br>Caffeine withdrawal is distinguished from caffeine-induced sleep disorder (e.g., caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type, with onset during withdrawal) because the sleep symptoms are in excess of those usually associated caffeine withdrawal, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Nonproblematic use of cannabis.</strong>
						<br>Although the majority of individuals who use cannabis do not have problems related to its use, 20%–30% of cannabis users do experience symptoms and associated consequences consistent with a cannabis use disorder. Differentiating nonproblematic use of cannabis and cannabis use disorder can be challenging because individuals may not attribute cannabis-related social, behavioral, or psychological problems to the substance, especially in the context of polysubstance use. Also, failure to acknowledge heavy cannabis use and its role in associated problems is common among individuals referred to treatment by others (i.e., school, family, employer, criminal justice system).</p>
					<p><strong>Cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, and cannabis-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Cannabis use disorder is differentiated from cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, and cannabis-induced mental disorders (e.g., cannabis-induced anxiety disorder) in that cannabis use disorder describes a problematic pattern of cannabis use that involves impaired control over cannabis use, social impairment due to cannabis use, risky cannabis use (e.g., driving while intoxicated), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance or withdrawal), whereas cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, and cannabis-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric syndromes that develop in the context of heavy use. Cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, and cannabis-induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with cannabis use disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or a cannabis- induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder, the presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.</p>

However, in contrast to cannabis intoxication, alcohol intoxication and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication frequently decrease appetite, increase aggressive behavior, and produce nystagmus or ataxia. Hallucinogens in low doses may cause a clinical picture that resembles cannabis intoxication. Phencyclidine, like cannabis, can be smoked and also causes perceptual changes, but phencyclidine intoxication is much more likely to cause ataxia and aggressive behavior.</p>
					<p><strong>Cannabis-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Cannabis intoxication is distinguished from cannabis-induced mental disorders (e.g., cannabis-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication) because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with cannabis intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>Because many of the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal are also symptoms of other substance withdrawal syndromes or of depressive or bipolar disorders, careful evaluation should focus on ensuring that the symptoms are not better explained by cessation of another substance (e.g., tobacco or alcohol withdrawal), another mental disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder), or another medical condition. Given the increasingly common belief that cannabis use is harmless, regular cannabis users experiencing cannabis withdrawal may not realize that their withdrawal symptoms are due to the effects of cannabis wearing off, and continue to use cannabis as a form of self-medication.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other substance disorders.</strong>
						<br>The effects of hallucinogen use must be distinguished from those of other substances (e.g., amphetamine use disorder, alcohol or sedative withdrawal), especially because contamination of the hallucinogens with other drugs is relatively common.</p>

					<p><strong>Hallucinogen intoxication and hallucinogen-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Hallucinogen use disorder is differentiated from hallucinogen intoxication and hallucinogen-induced mental disorders (e.g., hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder) in that hallucinogen use disorder describes a problematic pattern of hallucinogen use that involves impaired control over hallucinogen use, social impairment attributable to hallucinogen use, risky hallucinogen use (e.g., driving while intoxicated), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance), whereas hallucinogen intoxication and hallucinogen-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric syndromes that occur in the context of heavy use. Hallucinogen intoxication and hallucinogen- induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with hallucinogen use disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of hallucinogen intoxication or a hallucinogen-induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of hallucinogen use disorder, the presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.</p>

					<p><strong>Independent mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Some of the effects of hallucinogen use may resemble symptoms of independent psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and depressive and bipolar disorders. Discerning whether symptoms occurred before the intake of the drug is important in the differentiation of acute drug effects from a preexisting mental disorder. In particular, schizophrenia should be ruled out, as some affected individuals (e.g., individuals with schizophrenia who exhibit paranoia) may falsely attribute their symptoms to use of hallucinogens.</p>

					<h3>Phencyclidine Intoxication</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Recent use of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance).</li>
						<li>Clinically significant problematic behavioral changes (e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, impulsiveness, unpredictability, psychomotor agitation, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, phencyclidine use.</li>
						<li>Within 1 hour, two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:<br><strong>Note:</strong> When the drug is smoked, “snorted,” or used intravenously, the onset may be particularly rapid.</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Vertical or horizontal nystagmus.</li>
							<li>Hypertension or tachycardia.</li>

						<li>The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another substance.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there is a comorbid phencyclidine use disorder. If a mild phencyclidine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is <strong>F16.120</strong>, and if a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is <strong>F16.220</strong>. If there is no comorbid phencyclidine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is <strong>F16.920</strong>.</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>In particular, in the absence of intact reality testing (i.e., without insight that the perceptual abnormalities are drug induced), an additional diagnosis of phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder should be considered.</p>

					<p><strong>Other substance intoxication.</strong>
						<br>Phencyclidine intoxication should be differentiated from intoxication due to other substances, including other hallucinogens; amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulants; and anticholinergics, as well as withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Nystagmus and bizarre and violent behavior may distinguish intoxication due to phencyclidine from that due to other substances. Toxicological tests may be useful in making this distinction. However, the weak correlation between quantitative toxicology levels of phencyclidine and clinical presentation may diminish the utility of the laboratory findings for patient management.</p>

					<p><strong>Phencyclidine-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Phencyclidine intoxication is distinguished from phencyclidine-induced mental disorders (e.g., phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication) because the symptoms (e.g., depressed mood) in the latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with phencyclidine intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Medical conditions to be considered include certain metabolic disorders like hypoglycemia and hyponatremia, central nervous system tumors, seizure disorders, sepsis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and vascular insults.</p>

					<p><strong>Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder.</strong>
						<br>Other hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from hallucinogen persisting perception disorder because the symptoms in the latter continue episodically or continuously for weeks (or longer) after the most recent intoxication.</p>

						<br>Other hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from hallucinogen-induced mental disorders (e.g., hallucinogen-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication) because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with other hallucinogen intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, and opioid-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Opioid use disorder is differentiated from opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, and opioid-induced mental disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder) in that opioid use disorder describes a problematic pattern of opioid use that involves impaired control over opioid use, social impairment attributable to opioid use, risky opioid use (e.g., continued opioid use despite medical complications), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance or withdrawal), whereas opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, and opioid-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric syndromes that occur in the context of heavy use. Opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, and opioid-induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with opioid use disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or opioid-induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, the presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.</p>

					<p><strong>Other substance intoxication.</strong>
						<br>Alcohol intoxication and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication can cause a clinical picture that resembles that of opioid intoxication. A diagnosis of alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication can usually be made based on the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to naloxone challenge. In some cases, intoxication may be due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In these cases, the naloxone challenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects.</p>

					<p><strong>Other withdrawal disorders.</strong>

						<br>clinical picture that resembles opioid intoxication. A diagnosis of alcohol or sedative-hypnotic intoxication can usually be made based on the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to a naloxone challenge. In some cases, intoxication may be due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In these cases, naloxone administration will not reverse all of the sedative effects. While response to administration of naloxone can support the diagnosis of opioid intoxication, nonresponse may be due to the co- ingestion of an opioid with another drug (e.g., a benzodiazepine, alcohol) or to ingestion of a higher dose of and/or higher-potency opioid (e.g., fentanyl).</p>
					<p><strong>Opioid-induced mental disorders.</strong>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is differentiated from sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders (e.g., sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder) in that sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder describes a problematic pattern of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use that involves impaired control over such use; social impairment attributable to this use; risky sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use (e.g., driving while intoxicated); and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance or withdrawal); whereas sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric syndromes that occur in the context of heavy use. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or a sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic use disorder, the presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.</p>

					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>The slurred speech, incoordination, and other associated features characteristic of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication could be the result of another medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis) or of a prior head trauma (e.g., a subdural hematoma).</p>

					<p><strong>Alcohol use disorder.</strong>
						<br>Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder must be differentiated from alcohol use disorder. The differential diagnosis is determined mostly through clinical history, although liver damage and other potential signs of chronic alcohol toxicity (e.g., cardiomyopathy) can also be more suggestive of alcohol use disorder than of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Clinically appropriate use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications.</strong>
						<br>Individuals may continue to take benzodiazepine medication according to a physician’s direction for a legitimate medical indication over extended periods of time. Even if physiological signs of tolerance or withdrawal are manifested, many of these individuals do not develop symptoms that meet the criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder because they are not preoccupied with obtaining the substance and its use does not interfere with their performance of usual social or occupational roles.</p>

					<h3>Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Recent use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic.</li>
						<li>Clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use.</li>

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there is a comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.

If there is no comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is <strong>F13.920</strong>.</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Alcohol use disorder.</strong>
						<br>Because the clinical presentations may be identical, distinguishing sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication from alcohol use disorder requires evidence for recent ingestion of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications by self-report, informant report, or toxicological testing. Many individuals who misuse sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may also misuse alcohol and other substances, and so multiple intoxication diagnoses are possible.</p>

					<p><strong>Alcohol intoxication.</strong>
						<br>Alcohol intoxication may be distinguished from sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication by the smell of alcohol on the breath. Otherwise, the features of the two disorders may be similar.</p>

					<p><strong>Sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication is distinguished from sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders (e.g., sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal) because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in the latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; predominate in the clinical presentation; and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>In situations of cognitive impairment, traumatic brain injury, and delirium from other causes, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may be intoxicating at quite low dosages. The differential diagnosis in these complex settings is based on the predominant syndrome. An additional diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication may be appropriate even if the substance has been ingested at a low dosage in the setting of these other (or similar) co-occurring conditions.</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>The symptoms of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal may be mimicked by other medical conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis). If seizures are a feature of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal, the differential diagnosis includes the various causes of seizures (e.g., infections, head injury, poisonings).</p>

					<p><strong>Essential tremor.</strong>
						<br>Essential tremor, a neurological condition that frequently runs in families, may erroneously suggest the tremulousness associated with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.</p>

					<p><strong>Alcohol withdrawal.</strong>
						<br>Alcohol withdrawal produces a syndrome very similar to that of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal. The differential diagnosis is determined mostly through clinical history, although liver damage and other potential signs of chronic alcohol toxicity (e.g., cardiomyopathy) can also be more suggestive of alcohol withdrawal than of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.</p>

					<p><strong>Sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is distinguished from sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders (e.g., sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal) because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in the latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; predominate in the clinical presentation; and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Anxiety disorders.</strong>
						<br>Recurrence or worsening of an underlying anxiety disorder produces a syndrome similar to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal, although the most extreme manifestations of withdrawal, such as delirium tremens or true seizures, are not symptoms of any anxiety disorder. Withdrawal would be suspected with an abrupt reduction in the dosage of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medication. When a taper is under way, distinguishing the withdrawal syndrome from the underlying anxiety disorder can be difficult. As with alcohol, lingering withdrawal symptoms (e.g., anxiety, moodiness, trouble sleeping) can be mistaken for independent anxiety or depressive disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder).</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Phencyclidine intoxication.</strong>
						<br>Intoxication with phencyclidine (PCP or “angel dust”) or synthetic “designer drugs” such as mephedrone (known by different names, including “bath salts”) may cause a similar clinical picture and can only be distinguished from stimulant intoxication by the presence of cocaine or amphetamine-type substance metabolites in a urine or plasma sample.</p>

					<p><strong>Stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, and stimulant-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Stimulant use disorder is differentiated from stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, and stimulant- induced mental disorders (e.g., stimulant-induced depressive disorder) in that stimulant use disorder describes a problematic pattern of stimulant use that involves impaired control over stimulant use, social impairment attributable to stimulant use, risky stimulant use (e.g., continued stimulant use despite medical complications), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance or withdrawal), whereas stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, and stimulant-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric syndromes that occur in the context of heavy use. Stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, and stimulant-induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with stimulant use disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, or a stimulant-induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of stimulant use disorder, the presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.</p>

					<p><strong>Independent mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Some of the effects of stimulant use may resemble symptoms of independent mental disorders, such as psychosis (schizophrenia) and low mood (major depressive disorder). Discerning whether these behaviors occurred before the intake of the drug is important in the differentiation of acute drug effects from a preexisting mental disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Dose reduction after extended dosing, but not meeting the criteria for other (or unknown) substance withdrawal.</strong>
						<br>The individual used other (or unknown) substances, but the dose that was used was insufficient to produce symptoms that meet the criteria required for the withdrawal diagnosis.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance withdrawal or other substance/medication-induced mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Familiar substances may be sold in the black market as novel products, and individuals may experience withdrawal when discontinuing those substances. History, toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the substance itself may help to identify it. Other substance withdrawal is distinguished from other substance/medication-induced mental disorders (e.g., venlafaxine- induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal) because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in these latter disorders are in excess of symptoms (if known) usually associated with the specific substance withdrawal, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.</p>

					<p><strong>Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that impair brain function and cognition.</strong>
						<br>Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce rapid onset of signs and symptoms mimicking those of withdrawals. Paradoxically, drug intoxications also must be ruled out; for example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or intoxication with another substance.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Nondisordered gambling.</strong>
						<br>Gambling disorder must be distinguished from professional and social gambling. In professional gambling, risks are limited and discipline is central. Social gambling typically occurs with friends or colleagues and lasts for a limited period of time, with acceptable losses. Some persons can experience problems associated with gambling (e.g., short-term chasing behavior and loss of control) that do not meet the full criteria for gambling disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Manic episode.</strong>
						<br>Loss of judgment and excessive gambling may occur during a manic episode. An additional diagnosis of gambling disorder should be given only if the gambling behavior is not better explained by manic episodes (e.g., a history of maladaptive gambling behavior at times other than during a manic episode). Alternatively, an individual with gambling disorder may, during a period of gambling, exhibit behavior that resembles a manic episode, but once the individual is away from the gambling, these manic-like features dissipate.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Problems with gambling may occur in individuals with antisocial personality disorder and other personality disorders. If the criteria are met for both disorders, both can be diagnosed.</p>

					<p><strong>Gambling symptoms due to dopaminergic medications.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals taking dopaminergic medications (e.g., for Parkinson‘s disease) may experience urges to gamble that might be distressing or impairing enough to meet criteria for gambling disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of gambling disorder would be warranted.</p>

					<h3>Neurocognitive Domains</h3>
					<p>The criteria for the various NCDs are based on defined cognitive domains. Table 1 provides for each of the key domains a working definition, examples of symptoms or observations regarding impairments in everyday activities, and examples of assessments. The domains thus defined, along with guidelines for clinical thresholds, form the basis on which the NCDs, their levels, and their subtypes may be diagnosed.</p>

					<table>
						<tr><td colspan=3>Table 1. Neurocognitive domains</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Cognitive domain</td>
							<td>Examples of symptoms or observations</td>
							<td>Examples of assessments</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Complex attention (sustained attention, divided attention, selective attention, processing speed)</td>
							<td><strong>Major:</strong> Has increased difficulty in environments with multiple stimuli (TV, radio, conversation); is easily distracted by competing events in the environment. Is unable to attend unless input is restricted and simplified. Has difficulty holding new information in mind, such as recalling phone numbers or addresses just given, or reporting what was just said. Is unable to perform mental calculations. All thinking takes longer than usual, and components to be processed must be simplified to one or a few.
								<br><br><strong>Mild:</strong> Normal tasks take longer than previously. Begins to find errors in routine tasks; finds work needs more double-checking than previously. Thinking is easier when not competing with other things (radio, TV, other conversations, cell phone, driving).</td>
							<td><strong>Sustained attention:</strong> Maintenance of attention over time (e.g., pressing a button every time a tone is heard, and over a period of time).
								<br><br><strong>Selective attention:</strong> Maintenance of attention despite competing stimuli or distractors: hearing numbers and letters read and asked to count only letters.
								<br><br><strong>Divided attention:</strong> Attending to two tasks within the same time period: rapidly tapping while learning a story being read. Processing speed can be quantified on any task by timing it (e.g., time to put together a design of blocks; time to match symbols with numbers; speed in responding, such as counting speed or serial 3 speed).</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Executive function (planning, decision- making, working memory, responding to feedback/error correction, overriding habits/inhibition, mental flexibility)</td>
							<td><strong>Major:</strong> Abandons complex projects. Needs to focus on one task at a time. Needs to rely on others to plan instrumental activities of daily living or make decisions.
								<br><br><strong>Mild:</strong> Increased effort required to complete multistage projects. Has increased difficulty multitasking or difficulty resuming a task interrupted by a visitor or phone call. May complain of increased fatigue from the extra effort required to organize, plan, and make decisions. May report that large social gatherings are more taxing or less enjoyable because of increased effort required to follow shifting conversations.</td>
							<td><strong>Planning:</strong> Ability to find the exit to a maze; interpret a sequential picture or object arrangement.
								<br><br><strong>Decision-making:</strong> Performance of tasks that assess process of deciding in the face of competing alternatives (e.g., simulated gambling).
								<br><br><strong>Working memory:</strong> Ability to hold information for a brief period and to manipulate it (e.g., adding up a list of numbers or repeating a series of numbers or words backward).
								<br><br><strong>Feedback/error utilization:</strong> Ability to benefit from feedback to infer the rules for solving a problem.
								<br><br><strong>Overriding habits/inhibition:</strong> Ability to choose a more complex and effortful solution to be correct (e.g., looking away from the direction indicated by an arrow; naming the color of a word's font rather than naming the word)
								<br><br><strong>Mental/cognitive flexibility:</strong> Ability to shift between two concepts, tasks, or response rules (e.g., from number to letter, from verbal to key- press response, from adding numbers to ordering numbers, from ordering objects by size to ordering by color).</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Learning and memory (immediate memory, recent memory [including free recall, cued recall, and recognition memory], very-long-term memory [semantic; autobiographical], implicit learning)</td>
							<td><strong>Major:</strong> Repeats self in conversation, often within the same conversation. Cannot keep track of short list of items when shopping or of plans for the day. Requires frequent reminders to orient to task at hand.
							<br><br><strong>Mild:</strong> Has difficulty recalling recent events, and relies increasingly on list making or calendar. Needs occasional reminders or re-reading to keep track of characters in a movie or novel. Occasionally may repeat self over a few weeks to the same person. Loses track of whether bills have already been paid.
							<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Except in severe forms of major neurocognitive disorder, semantic, autobiographical, and implicit learning are relatively preserved, compared with recent memory.</td>
							<td><strong>Immediate memory span:</strong> Ability to repeat a list of words or digits. <strong>Note:</strong> Immediate memory sometimes subsumed under “working memory” (see “Executive Function”).
								<br><br><strong>Recent memory:</strong> Assesses the process of encoding new information (e.g., word lists, a short story, or diagrams). The aspects of recent memory that can be tested include 1) free recall (the individual is asked to recall as many words, diagrams, or elements of a story as possible); 2) cued recall (examiner aids recall by providing semantic cues such as “List all the food items on the list” or “Name all of the children from the story”); and 3) recognition memory (examiner asks about specific items— e.g., “Was ’apple’ on the list?” or “Did you see this diagram or figure?”). Other aspects of memory that can be assessed include semantic memory (memory for facts), autobiographical memory (memory for personal events or people), and implicit (procedural) learning (unconscious learning of skills).</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Language (expressive language [including naming, word finding, fluency, and grammar, and syntax] and receptive language)</td>
							<td><strong>Major:</strong> Has significant difficulties with expressive or receptive language. Often uses general-use phrases such as “that thing” and “you know what I mean,” and prefers general pronouns rather than names. With severe impairment, may not even recall names of closer friends and family. Idiosyncratic word usage, grammatical errors, and spontaneity of output and economy of utterances occur. Stereotypy of speech occurs; echolalia and automatic speech typically precede mutism.
							<br><br><strong>Mild:</strong> Has noticeable word-finding difficulty. May substitute general for specific terms. May avoid use of specific names of acquaintances. Grammatical errors involve subtle omission or incorrect use of articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, etc.</td>
							<td><strong>Expressive language:</strong> Confrontational naming (identification of objects or pictures); fluency (e.g., name as many items as possible in a semantic [e.g., animals] or phonemic [e.g., words starting with “f”] category in 1 minute).
							<br><br><strong>Grammar and syntax</strong> (e.g., omission or incorrect use of articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs): Errors observed during naming and fluency tests are compared with norms to assess frequency of errors and compare with normal slips of the tongue.
							<br><br><strong>Receptive language:</strong> Comprehension (word definition and object-pointing tasks involving animate and inanimate stimuli): performance of actions/activities according to verbal command.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Perceptual-motor (includes abilities subsumed under the terms visual perception, visuoconstructional, perceptual-motor, praxis, and gnosis)</td>
							<td><strong>Major:</strong> Has significant difficulties with previously familiar activities (using tools, driving motor vehicle), navigating in familiar environments; is often more confused at dusk, when shadows and lowering levels of light change perceptions.
								<br><br><strong>Mild:</strong> May need to rely more on maps or others for directions. Uses notes and follows others to get to a new place. May find self lost or turned around when not concentrating on task. Is less precise in parking. Needs to expend greater effort for spatial tasks such as carpentry, assembly, sewing, or knitting.</td>
							<td><strong>Visual perception:</strong> Line bisection tasks can be used to detect basic visual defect or attentional neglect. Motor-free perceptual tasks (including facial recognition) require the identification and/or matching of figures—best when tasks cannot be verbally mediated (e.g., figures are not objects); some require the decision of whether a figure can be “real” or not based on dimensionality.
							<br><br><strong>Visuoconstructional:</strong> Assembly of items requiring hand-eye coordination, such as drawing, copying, and block assembly.
							<br><br><strong>Perceptual-motor:</strong> Integrating perception with purposeful movement (e.g., inserting blocks into a form board without visual cues; rapidly inserting pegs into a slotted board).
							<br><br><strong>Praxis:</strong> Integrity of learned movements, such as ability to imitate gestures (wave goodbye) or pantomime use of objects to command (“Show me how you would use a hammer”).
							<br><br><strong>Gnosis:</strong> Perceptual integrity of awareness and recognition, such as recognition of faces and colors.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Social cognition (recognition of emotions, theory of mind)</td>
							<td><strong>Major:</strong> Behavior clearly out of acceptable social range; shows insensitivity to social standards of modesty in dress or of political, religious, or sexual topics of conversation. Focuses excessively on a topic despite group’s disinterest or direct feedback. Behavioral intention without regard to family or friends. Makes decisions without regard to safety (e.g., inappropriate clothing for weather or social setting). Typically, has little insight into these changes.<br><br><strong>Mild:</strong> Has subtle changes in behavior or attitude, often described as a change in personality, such as less ability to recognize social cues or read facial expressions, decreased empathy, increased extraversion or introversion, decreased inhibition, or subtle or episodic apathy or restlessness.</td>
							<td><strong>Recognition of emotions:</strong> Identification of emotion in images of faces representing a variety of both positive and negative emotions.
							<br><br><strong>Theory of mind:</strong> Ability to consider another person’s mental state (thoughts, desires, intentions) or experience—story cards with questions to elicit information about the mental state of the individuals portrayed, such as “Where will the girl look for the lost bag?” or “Why is the boy sad?”</td></tr>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders and bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features.</strong>
						<br>Delirium that is characterized by vivid hallucinations, delusions, language disturbances, and agitation must be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and other psychotic disorders, as well as from manic or major depressive episodes, with psychotic features.</p>

					<p><strong>Acute stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>Delirium associated with fear, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization, must be distinguished from acute stress disorder, which is precipitated by exposure to a severely traumatic event.</p>

					<p><strong>Malingering and factitious disorder.</strong>
						<br>Delirium can be distinguished from these disorders on the basis of the often atypical symptomatic presentation in malingering and factitious disorder and the absence of another medical condition or substance that is etiologically related to the apparent cognitive disturbance.</p>

					<p><strong>Other neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>The most common differential diagnostic issue when evaluating confusion in older adults is disentangling symptoms of delirium and major NCD. The clinician must determine whether the individual has delirium; a delirium superimposed on a preexisting NCD, such as that due to Alzheimer’s disease; or an NCD without delirium. The traditional distinction between delirium and major NCD according to acuteness of onset and temporal course is particularly difficult in those elderly individuals who had a prior NCD that may not have been recognized, or who developed persistent cognitive impairment following an episode of delirium. When delirium and major NCD are comorbid, the management of the delirium should generally be given priority.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Normal cognition.</strong>
						<br>The differential diagnosis between normal cognition and mild NCD, as between mild and major NCD, is challenging because the boundaries are inherently arbitrary. Careful history taking and objective assessment are critical to these distinctions. A longitudinal evaluation using quantified assessments may be key in detecting mild NCD.</p>

					<p><strong>Delirium.</strong>
						<br>Both mild and major NCD may be difficult to distinguish from a persistent delirium, which can co-occur. Careful assessment of attention and arousal will help to make the distinction.</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>The distinction between mild NCD and major depressive disorder, which may co-occur with NCD, can also be challenging. Specific patterns of cognitive deficits may be helpful. For example, consistent memory and executive function deficits are typical of Alzheimer’s disease, whereas nonspecific or more variable performance is seen in major depression. Alternatively, treatment of the depressive disorder with repeated observation over time may be required to make the diagnosis.</p>

					<p><strong>Specific learning disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders.</strong>
						<br>A careful clarification of the individual’s baseline status will help distinguish an NCD from a specific learning disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Additional issues may enter the differential for specific etiological subtypes, as described in the relevant sections.</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Major and mild NCDs due to other neurodegenerative processes (e.g., Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration) share the insidious onset and gradual decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease but have distinctive core features of their own (which are not always present). For example, NCD with Lewy bodies is typically characterized by frequent fluctuations in cognition early in the disease, parkinsonian features, gait imbalances, and visual hallucinations. Individuals with frontotemporal NCD may present with a distinct behavioral or language variant. The behavioral variant typically first manifests with prominent changes in social behavior, such as disinhibition, apathy, or perseverative behavior, that may not infrequently lead to a primary psychiatric diagnosis. In contrast, the language variant of frontotemporal NCD may manifest with impairments in expressive language or word comprehension.<br>In major or mild vascular NCD, there is typically a history of stroke temporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment, and infarcts or hemosiderin deposits observed on brain imaging can be judged sufficient to account for the clinical picture. However, major or mild vascular NCD shares many clinical features with Alzheimer’s disease; frequently Alzheimer’s pathology is present alone or in combination with vascular pathologies. It should be noted that white matter change alone does not constitute enough evidence of cerebrovascular disease to propose a mixed etiology if the other diagnostic considerations support the diagnosis of NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease. The presence of subcortical ischemic changes on neuroimaging must be interpreted carefully in view of whether concurrent Alzheimer’s pathology is present.</p>

					<p><strong>Other concurrent, active neurological or systemic illness.</strong>
						<br>Other neurological or systemic illness should be considered if there is an appropriate temporal relationship and severity to account for the clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be difficult to distinguish an Alzheimer’s disease etiology from that of another medical condition (e.g., thyroid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency).</p>

					<p><strong>Major depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Particularly at the mild NCD level, the differential diagnosis also includes major depression. The presence of depression may be associated with reduced daily functioning and poor concentration that may resemble an NCD, but improvement with treatment of depression may be useful in making the distinction. If the symptoms meeting criteria for a major depressive episode are judged to be due to the physiological effects of Alzheimer’s disease, a diagnosis of depressive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with major depressive– like episode, should be given instead of major depressive disorder.</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Other neurodegenerative diseases may be distinguished from major or mild frontotemporal NCD by their characteristic features. In major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, decline in learning and memory is an early feature. However, 10%–30% of individuals presenting with a syndrome suggestive of major or mild frontotemporal NCD are found at autopsy to have Alzheimer’s disease pathology. This occurs more frequently in individuals who present with progressive dysexecutive syndromes in the absence of behavioral changes or movement disorder or in those with the logopenic variant.<br>In major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, core and suggestive features of Lewy bodies must be present. In major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, spontaneous parkinsonism emerges well before the cognitive decline. In major or mild vascular NCD, depending on affected brain regions, there may also be loss of executive function and behavioral changes such as apathy, and this disorder should be considered in the differential diagnosis. However, history of a cerebrovascular event is temporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment in major or mild vascular NCD, and neuroimaging reveals infarctions or white matter lesions sufficient to account for the clinical picture.</p>

					<p><strong>Other neurological conditions.</strong>
						<br>Major or mild frontotemporal NCD overlaps with progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and motor neuron disease clinically as well as pathologically. Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by supranuclear gaze palsies and axial-predominant parkinsonism. Pseudobulbar signs may be present, and retropulsion (losing balance in a backward direction) is often prominent. Neurocognitive assessment shows psychomotor slowing, poor working memory, and executive dysfunction. Corticobasal degeneration presents with asymmetric rigidity, limb apraxia, postural instability, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, and cortical sensory loss. Many individuals with behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD show features of motor neuron disease, which tend to be mixed upper and predominantly lower motor neuron disease.</p>

					<p><strong>Other mental disorders and medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD may be mistaken for a primary mental disorder, such as major depression, bipolar disorders, or schizophrenia, and individuals with this variant often present initially to psychiatry. Over time, the development of progressive neurocognitive difficulties will help to make the distinction. A careful medical evaluation will help to exclude treatable causes of NCDs, such as metabolic disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and infections. If the symptoms characteristic of a primary mental disorder (e.g., delusions) are judged to be due to the physiological effects of frontotemporal degeneration, a diagnosis of the appropriate mental disorder due to frontotemporal degeneration should be given instead of the primary psychotic disorder (e.g., psychotic disorder due to frontotemporal degeneration, with delusions).</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease.</strong>
						<br>The distinction between NCDLB and NCD due to Parkinson’s disease is based on the timing and sequence of motor symptoms and cognitive symptoms. Consensus criteria for DLB separate NCDLB from NCD due to Parkinson’s disease by specifying that for dementia to be attributed to Parkinson’s disease, the Parkinson’s disease diagnosis is present for at least 1 year before cognitive decline has reached the level of major NCD, whereas for NCDLB, the cognitive symptoms may begin before, with, or in the absence of parkinsonism. By contrast, expert consensus criteria for Parkinson’s disease propose that if cognitive decline occurs prior to a motor diagnosis, the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease may still be made; therefore, a clinician may attribute the cognitive decline to the Parkinson’s disease and diagnose NCD due to Parkinson’s disease. Consequently, the clinician may choose to diagnose NCD due to Parkinson’s disease or NCDLB for individuals with major NCD that starts either before or within 12 months of Parkinson’s disease. In such circumstances, the clinician decides which diagnosis is more appropriate. If Parkinson’s disease has been diagnosed for at least 1 year prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms, then both expert criteria agree that NCD due to Parkinson’s disease would typically be the appropriate diagnosis. The timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be particularly difficult to determine, and unspecified NCD may need to be diagnosed until the order of clinical progression becomes evident.</p>

					<p><strong>Other neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>Since incidental brain infarctions and white matter lesions are common in older individuals, it is important to consider other possible etiologies when an NCD is present in an individual with white matter lesions. A history of memory deficit early in the course, and progressive worsening of memory, language, executive function, and perceptual- motor abilities in the absence of corresponding focal lesions on brain imaging, are suggestive of Alzheimer’s disease as the primary diagnosis. Potential biomarkers currently being validated for Alzheimer’s disease, such as cerebrospinal fluid levels of β-amyloid and phosphorylated tau, and amyloid and tau imaging, may prove to be helpful in the differential diagnosis. NCD with Lewy bodies is distinguished from major or mild vascular NCD by its core features of fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and spontaneous parkinsonism. While deficits in executive function and language occur in major or mild vascular NCD, the insidious onset and gradual progression of behavioral features or language impairment are characteristic of frontotemporal NCD and are not typical of vascular etiology.</p>

					<p><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is not made if other diseases (e.g., brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, toxic or metabolic disorders) are present and are of sufficient severity to account for the cognitive impairment.</p>

					<p><strong>Other mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is inappropriate if the symptoms can be entirely attributed to delirium, although delirium may sometimes be superimposed on a preexisting major or mild vascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses can be made. If the criteria for major depressive disorder are met and the cognitive impairment is temporally related to the likely onset of the depression, major or mild vascular NCD should not be diagnosed. However, if the NCD preceded the development of the depression, or the severity of the cognitive impairment is out of proportion to the severity of the depression, depressive disorder due to cerebrovascular disease should be diagnosed instead of major depressive disorder.</p>

					<p>Individuals with substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal are at increased risk for other conditions that may independently, or through a compounding effect, result in neurocognitive disturbance. These include history of traumatic brain injury and infections that can accompany substance use disorder (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Therefore, presence of substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD should be differentiated from NCDs arising outside the context of substance use, intoxication, and withdrawal, including these accompanying conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury).</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>In the presence of comorbidities, such as other infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, syphilis), substance use disorder (e.g., methamphetamine use disorder), prior traumatic brain injury, or neurodevelopmental conditions, major or mild NCD due to HIV infection can be diagnosed provided there is evidence that infection with HIV has worsened any NCDs because of such preexisting or comorbid conditions. Among older adults, onset of neurocognitive decline related to cerebrovascular disease or primary neurodegeneration (e.g., major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease) may need to be differentiated; these conditions may be suggested by a relatively more progressive course of decline than is seen in NCD due to HIV. HIV infection itself has been shown to increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Because more severe immunodeficiency can result in opportunistic infections of the brain (e.g., toxoplasmosis; cryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS lymphoma), sudden onset of an NCD or sudden worsening of an NCD demands active investigation of non-HIV etiologies. Delirium is important to consider because it occurs frequently over the disease course of individuals with HIV and may be due to multiple etiologies (including SARS-CoV-2 co- infection).</p>

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies (NCDLB).</strong>
						<br>The distinction between NCDLB and NCD due to Parkinson’s disease is based on the timing and sequence of motor symptoms and cognitive symptoms. Consensus criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies separate NCDLB from NCD due to Parkinson’s disease by specifying that for dementia to be attributed to Parkinson’s disease, the Parkinson’s disease diagnosis must be present for at least 1 year before cognitive decline has reached the level of major NCD, whereas for NCDLB, the cognitive symptoms may begin before, with, or in the absence of parkinsonism. By contrast, expert consensus criteria for Parkinson’s disease propose that if cognitive decline occurs prior to a motor diagnosis, the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease may still be made; therefore, a clinician may attribute the cognitive decline to the Parkinson’s disease and diagnose NCD due to Parkinson’s disease. Consequently, the clinician may choose to diagnose NCD due to Parkinson’s disease or NCDLB for individuals with major NCD that starts either before or within 12 months of Parkinson’s disease. In such circumstances, the clinician decides which diagnosis is more appropriate. If Parkinson’s disease has been diagnosed for at least 1 year prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms, then both expert criteria agree that NCD due to Parkinson’s disease would typically be the appropriate diagnosis. The timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be particularly difficult to determine, and unspecified NCD may need to be diagnosed until the order of clinical progression becomes evident.</p>

					<p><strong>Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease.</strong>
						<br>The motor features are the key to distinguishing major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease from major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease. However, the two disorders can co-occur, and individuals with well- established Alzheimer’s disease can develop mild parkinsonism.</p>

					<p><strong>Major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Major or mild vascular NCD may manifest with parkinsonian features that may occur as a consequence of diffuse cortical or subcortical small vessel disease. However, the parkinsonian features typically are not sufficient for a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, and the course of the NCD usually has a clear association with cerebrovascular changes.</p>

					<p><strong>Neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., neurodegenerative disorders).</strong>
						<br>When a diagnosis of major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease is being considered, the distinction must also be made from other brain disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, tumors, and hydrocephalus.</p>

					<p><strong>Antipsychotic (or other dopamine receptor–blocking drug)–induced parkinsonism.</strong>
						<br>Antipsychotic (or other dopamine receptor–blocking drug)–induced parkinsonism can occur in individuals with other NCDs, particularly when antipsychotic medications are prescribed for the behavioral manifestations of such disorders.</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Early symptoms of Huntington’s disease may include instability of mood, irritability, or compulsive behaviors that may suggest another mental disorder. However, genetic testing or the development of motor symptoms will distinguish the presence of Huntington’s disease. In such cases, if the mood symptoms are a focus of clinical attention, they may be indicated by an additional diagnosis of depressive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, with depressive features.</p>

					<p><strong>Other neurocognitive disorders.</strong>
						<br>The early symptoms of Huntington’s disease, particularly symptoms of executive dysfunction and impaired psychomotor speed, may resemble other neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as major or mild vascular NCD.</p>

Rarely, individuals may present with a course similar to that of Huntington’s disease but without positive genetic testing; this is considered to be a Huntington’s disease phenocopy that results from a variety of potential genetic factors.</p>

					<h3>General Personality Disorder</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events).</li>
							<li>Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response).</li>
							<li>Interpersonal functioning.</li>
							<li>Impulse control.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations.</li>
						<li>The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood.</li>
						<li>The enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder.</li>
						<li>The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma).</li>
					</ul>


					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders and personality traits.</strong>
						<br>Many of the specific criteria for the personality disorders describe features (e.g., suspiciousness, dependency, insensitivity) that are also characteristic of episodes of other mental disorders. A personality disorder should be diagnosed only when the defining characteristics appeared before early adulthood, are typical of the individual’s long-term functioning, and do not occur exclusively during an episode of another mental disorder. It may be particularly difficult (and not particularly useful) to distinguish personality disorders from persistent mental disorders such as persistent depressive disorder that have an early onset and an enduring, relatively stable course. Some personality disorders may have a “spectrum” relationship to other mental disorders (e.g., schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia; avoidant personality disorder with social anxiety disorder) based on phenomenological or biological similarities or familial aggregation.<br>Personality disorders must be distinguished from personality traits that do not reach threshold for a personality disorder. Personality traits are diagnosed as a personality disorder only when they are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress.</p>

					<p><strong>Psychotic disorders.</strong>
						<br>For the three personality disorders that may be related to the psychotic disorders (i.e., paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal), there is an exclusion criterion stating that the pattern of behavior must not have occurred exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder. When an individual has a persistent mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by a preexisting personality disorder, the personality disorder should also be recorded, followed by “premorbid” in parentheses.</p>

					<p><strong>Anxiety and depressive disorders.</strong>
						<br>The clinician must be cautious in diagnosing personality disorders during an episode of a depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder, because these conditions may have cross-sectional symptom features that mimic personality traits and may make it more difficult to evaluate retrospectively the individual’s long-term patterns of functioning.</p>

					<p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder.</strong>
						<br>When personality changes emerge and persist after an individual has been exposed to extreme stress, a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder should be considered.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>When an individual has a substance use disorder, it is important not to make a personality disorder diagnosis based solely on behaviors that are consequences of substance intoxication or withdrawal or that are associated with activities in the service of sustaining substance use (e.g., antisocial behavior).</p>

					<p><strong>Personality change due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>When enduring changes in personality arise as a result of the physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g., brain tumor), a diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition should be considered.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="Ch18_2" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Paranoid Personality Disorder<br>F60.0</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are interpreted as malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving him or her.</li>
							<li>Is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates.</li>
							<li>Is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against him or her.</li>
							<li>Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events.</li>
							<li>Persistently bears grudges (i.e., is unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights).</li>
							<li>Perceives attacks on his or her character or reputation that are not apparent to others and is quick to react angrily or to counterattack.</li>
							<li>Has recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding fidelity of spouse or sexual partner.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder and is not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” i.e., “paranoid personality disorder (premorbid).”</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.</strong>
						<br>Paranoid personality disorder can be distinguished from delusional disorder, persecutory type; schizophrenia; and a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features because these disorders are all characterized by a period of persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). For an additional diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder to be given, the personality disorder must have been present before the onset of psychotic symptoms and must persist when the psychotic symptoms are in remission. When an individual has another persistent mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by paranoid personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder should also be recorded, followed by “premorbid” in parentheses.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality change due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Paranoid personality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge are a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Paranoid personality disorder must be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>

					<p><strong>Paranoid traits associated with physical handicaps.</strong>
						<br>The disorder must also be distinguished from paranoid traits associated with the development of physical handicaps (e.g., a hearing impairment).</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders and personality traits.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with paranoid personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to paranoid personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Paranoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder share the traits of suspiciousness, interpersonal aloofness, and paranoid ideation, but schizotypal personality disorder also includes symptoms such as magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, and odd thinking and speech. Individuals with behaviors that meet criteria for schizoid personality disorder are often perceived as strange, eccentric, cold, and aloof, but they do not usually have prominent paranoid ideation. The tendency of individuals with paranoid personality disorder to react to minor stimuli with anger is also seen in borderline and histrionic personality disorders. However, these disorders are not necessarily associated with pervasive suspiciousness, and borderline personality disorder exhibits higher levels of impulsivity and self-destructive behavior. People with avoidant personality disorder may also be reluctant to confide in others, but more from fear of being embarrassed or found inadequate than from fear of others’ malicious intent. Although antisocial behavior may be present in some individuals with paranoid personality disorder, it is not usually motivated by a desire for personal gain or to exploit others as in antisocial personality disorder, but rather is more often attributable to a desire for revenge. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may occasionally display suspiciousness, social withdrawal, or alienation, but this derives primarily from fears of having their imperfections or flaws revealed.</p>

					<p>Paranoid traits may be adaptive, particularly in threatening environments. Paranoid personality disorder should be diagnosed only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress.</p>

					<h3>Schizoid Personality Disorder<br>F60.1</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:</li>

							<li>Appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others.</li>
							<li>Shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder and is not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” i.e., “schizoid personality disorder (premorbid).”</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.</strong>
						<br>Schizoid personality disorder can be distinguished from delusional disorder, schizophrenia, and a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features because these disorders are all characterized by a period of persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). To give an additional diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder, the personality disorder must have been present before the onset of psychotic symptoms and must persist when the psychotic symptoms are in remission. When an individual has a persistent psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by schizoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder should also be recorded, followed by “premorbid” in parentheses.</p>

					<p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder.</strong>
						<br>There may be great difficulty differentiating individuals with schizoid personality disorder from individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly with milder forms of either disorder, as both include a seeming indifference to companionship with others. However, autism spectrum disorder may be differentiated by stereotyped behaviors and interests.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality change due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Schizoid personality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge are a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Schizoid personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders and personality traits.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with schizoid personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to schizoid personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although characteristics of social isolation and restricted affectivity are common to schizoid, schizotypal, and paranoid personality disorders, schizoid personality disorder can be distinguished from schizotypal personality disorder by the lack of cognitive and perceptual distortions and from paranoid personality disorder by the lack of suspiciousness and paranoid ideation. The social isolation of schizoid personality disorder can be distinguished from that of avoidant personality disorder, which is attributable to fear of being embarrassed or found inadequate and excessive anticipation of rejection. In contrast, people with schizoid personality disorder have a more pervasive detachment and limited desire for social intimacy. Individuals with obsessive- compulsive personality disorder may also show an apparent social detachment stemming from devotion to work and discomfort with emotions, but they do have an underlying capacity for intimacy.

					<p>Individuals who are “loners” or quite introverted may display personality traits that might be considered schizoid, consistent with the broader conceptualization of schizoid personality disorder as a disorder defined by pathological introversion/detachment. Only when these traits are inflexible and maladaptive and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute schizoid personality disorder.</p>

					<h3>Schizotypal Personality Disorder<br>F21</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference).</li>
							<li>Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or “sixth sense”; in children and adolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations).</li>
							<li>Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions.</li>
							<li>Odd thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate, or stereotyped).</li>
							<li>Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation.</li>
							<li>Inappropriate or constricted affect.</li>
							<li>Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar.</li>
							<li>Lack of close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives.</li>
							<li>Excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgments about self.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” e.g., “schizotypal personality disorder (premorbid).”</p>


					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.</strong>
						<br>Schizotypal personality disorder can be distinguished from delusional disorder, schizophrenia, and a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features because these disorders are all characterized by a period of persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). To give an additional diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder, the personality disorder must have been present before the onset of psychotic symptoms and persist when the psychotic symptoms are in remission. When an individual has a persistent psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by schizotypal personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder should also be recorded, followed by “premorbid” in parentheses.</p>

					<p><strong>Neurodevelopmentaldisorders.</strong>
						<br>There may be great difficulty differentiating children with schizotypal personality disorder from the heterogeneous group of solitary, odd children whose behavior is characterized by marked social isolation, eccentricity, or peculiarities of language and whose diagnoses would probably include milder forms of autism spectrum disorder or language communication disorders. Communication disorders may be differentiated by the primacy and severity of the disorder in language and by the characteristic features of impaired language found in a specialized language assessment. Milder forms of autism spectrum disorder are differentiated by the even greater lack of social awareness and emotional reciprocity and stereotyped behaviors and interests.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality change due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Schizotypal personality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge are a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Schizotypal personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders and personality traits.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with schizotypal personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to schizotypal personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although paranoid and schizoid personality disorders may also be characterized by social detachment and restricted affect, schizotypal personality disorder can be distinguished from these two diagnoses by the presence of cognitive or perceptual distortions and marked eccentricity or oddness. Close relationships are limited in both schizotypal personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder; however, in avoidant personality disorder an active desire for relationships is constrained by a fear of rejection, whereas in schizotypal personality disorder there is a lack of desire for relationships and persistent detachment. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may also display suspiciousness, social withdrawal, or alienation, but in narcissistic personality disorder these qualities derive primarily from fears of having imperfections or flaws revealed. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may also have transient, psychotic-like symptoms, but these are usually more closely related to affective shifts in response to stress (e.g., intense anger, anxiety, disappointment) and are usually more dissociative (e.g., derealization, depersonalization). In contrast, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder are more likely to have enduring psychotic-like symptoms that may worsen under stress but are less likely to be invariably associated with pronounced affective symptoms. Although social isolation may occur in borderline personality disorder, it is usually secondary to repeated interpersonal failures due to angry outbursts and frequent mood shifts, rather than a result of a persistent lack of social contacts and desire for intimacy. Furthermore, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder do not usually demonstrate the impulsive or manipulative behaviors of the individual with borderline personality disorder. However, there is a high rate of co-occurrence between the two disorders, so that making such distinctions is not always feasible. Schizotypal features during adolescence may be reflective of transient emotional turmoil rather than an enduring personality disorder.</p>

					<h3>Antisocial Personality Disorder<br>F60.2</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of the following:</li>
						<ul class="number">
							<li>Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors, as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest.</li>
							<li>Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure.</li>
							<li>Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.</li>
							<li>Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults.</li>
							<li>Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.</li>
							<li>Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations.</li>
							<li>Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The individual is at least age 18 years.</li>
						<li>There is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years.</li>
						<li>The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.</li>
					</ul>


					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p>The diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is not given to individuals younger than 18 years and is given only if there is evidence of conduct disorder before age 15 years. For individuals older than 18 years, a diagnosis of conduct disorder is given only if the criteria for antisocial personality disorder are not met.</p>
					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>When antisocial behavior in an adult is associated with a substance use disorder, the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is not made unless the signs of antisocial personality disorder were also present in childhood and have continued into adulthood. When substance use and antisocial behavior both began in childhood and continued into adulthood, both a substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder should be diagnosed if the criteria for both are met, even though some antisocial acts may be a consequence of the substance use disorder (e.g., illegal selling of drugs, thefts to obtain money for drugs).</p>

					<p><strong>Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>Antisocial behavior that occurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder should not be diagnosed as antisocial personality disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with antisocial personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to antisocial personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial, exploitative, and lack empathy. However, narcissistic personality disorder does not include characteristics of impulsivity, aggression, and deceit. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of others, and persons with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack the history of conduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder share a tendency to be impulsive, superficial, excitement seeking, reckless, seductive, and manipulative, but persons with histrionic personality disorder tend to be more exaggerated in their emotions and do not characteristically engage in antisocial behaviors. Individuals with histrionic and borderline personality disorders are manipulative to gain nurturance, whereas those with antisocial personality disorder are manipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material gratification. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder tend to be less emotionally unstable and more aggressive than those with borderline personality disorder. Although antisocial behavior may be present in some individuals with paranoid personality disorder, it is not usually motivated by a desire for personal gain or to exploit others as in antisocial personality disorder, but rather is more often attributable to a desire for revenge.</p>

					<p><strong>Criminal behavior not associated with a mental disorder.</strong>
						<br>Antisocial personality disorder must be distinguished from antisocial behavior not due to a mental disorder, for example, criminal behavior undertaken for gain that is not accompanied by the personality features characteristic of this disorder. In these cases, the condition adult antisocial behavior may be coded (see “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”).</p>

				<div id="Ch18_6" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Borderline Personality Disorder<br>F60.3</h3>
					<p>A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:</p>
					<ul class="number">
						<li>Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. (<strong>Note:</strong> Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)</li>
						<li>A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.</li>
						<li>Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.</li>
						<li>Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). (<strong>Note:</strong> Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)</li>
						<li>Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.</li>
						<li>Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).</li>
						<li>Chronic feelings of emptiness.</li>
						<li>Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).</li>
						<li>Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Depressive and bipolar disorders.</strong>
						<br>Borderline personality disorder often co-occurs with depressive or bipolar disorders, and when criteria for both are met, both should be diagnosed. Because the cross-sectional presentation of borderline personality disorder can be mimicked by an episode of depressive or bipolar disorder, the clinician should avoid giving an additional diagnosis of borderline personality disorder based only on cross-sectional presentation without having documented that the pattern of behavior had an early onset and a long-standing course.</p>

					<p><strong>Separation anxiety disorder in adults.</strong>
						<br>Separation anxiety disorder and borderline personality disorder are characterized by fear of abandonment by loved ones, but problems in identity, self- direction, interpersonal functioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to borderline personality disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with borderline personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to borderline personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although histrionic personality disorder can also be characterized by attention seeking, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions, borderline personality disorder is distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and chronic feelings of deep emptiness and loneliness. Paranoid ideas or illusions may be present in both borderline personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder, but these symptoms are more transient, interpersonally reactive, and responsive to external structuring in borderline personality disorder. Although paranoid personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder may also be characterized by an angry reaction to minor stimuli, the relative stability of self-image, as well as the relative lack of physical self-destructiveness, repetitive impulsivity, and profound abandonment concerns, distinguishes these disorders from borderline personality disorder. Although antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder are both characterized by manipulative behavior, individuals with antisocial personality disorder are manipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material gratification, whereas the goal in borderline personality disorder is directed more toward gaining the concern of caretakers. Both dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder are characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual with borderline personality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of emotional emptiness, rage, and demands, whereas the individual with dependent personality disorder reacts with increasing appeasement and submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide caregiving and support. Borderline personality disorder can further be distinguished from dependent personality disorder by the typical pattern of unstable and intense relationships.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality change due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Borderline personality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge are a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Borderline personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>

					<p><strong>Identity problems.</strong>
						<br>Borderline personality disorder should be distinguished from an identity problem, which is reserved for identity concerns related to a developmental phase (e.g., adolescence) and does not qualify as a mental disorder. Adolescents and young adults with identity problems (especially when accompanied by substance use) may transiently display behaviors that misleadingly give the impression of borderline personality disorder. Such situations are characterized by emotional instability, existential dilemmas, uncertainty, anxiety- provoking choices, conflicts about sexual orientation, and competing social pressures to decide on careers.

Although individuals with narcissistic personality disorder also crave attention from others, they usually want praise for their “superiority,” whereas individuals with histrionic personality disorder are willing to be viewed as fragile or dependent if this is instrumental in getting attention. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may exaggerate the intimacy of their relationships with other people, but they are more apt to emphasize the “VIP” status or wealth of their friends. In dependent personality disorder, the individual is excessively dependent on others for praise and guidance, but is without the flamboyant, exaggerated, emotional features of individuals with histrionic personality disorder.<br>Many individuals may display histrionic personality traits.

					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Other personality disorders and personality traits.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with narcissistic personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to narcissistic personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. The most useful feature in discriminating narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders, in which the interactive styles are coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively, is the grandiosity characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. The relative stability of self-image and self-control as well as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impulsivity, separation insecurity, and emotional hyperreactivity also help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline personality disorder.<br>Excessive pride in achievements, a relative lack of emotional display, and ignorance of or disdain for others’ sensitivities help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic personality disorder. Although individuals with borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders may require much attention, those with narcissistic personality disorder specifically need that attention to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial, exploitative, and unempathic. However, narcissistic personality disorder does not necessarily include characteristics of impulsive aggressivity and deceitfulness. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality disorder may be more indifferent and less sensitive to others’ reactions or criticism, and individuals with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack the history of conduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood.<br>In both narcissistic personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the individual may profess a commitment to perfectionism and believe that others cannot do things as well. However, while those with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder tend to be more immersed in perfectionism related to order and rigidity, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder tend to set high perfectionistic standards, especially for appearance and performance, and to be critically concerned if they are not measuring up.<br>Suspiciousness and social withdrawal usually distinguish those with schizotypal, avoidant, or paranoid personality disorder from those with narcissistic personality disorder. When these qualities are present in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, they derive primarily from shame and fear of failure, or fear of having imperfections or flaws revealed.<br>Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Mania or hypomania.</strong>
						<br>Grandiosity may emerge as part of manic or hypomanic episodes, but the association with mood change or functional impairments helps distinguish these episodes from narcissistic personality disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Narcissistic personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>

					<p><strong>Persistent depressive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Experiences that threaten self-esteem can evoke a deep sense of inferiority and sustained feelings of shame, envy, self-criticism, and insecurity in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder that can result in persistent negative feelings resembling those seen in persistent depressive disorder. If criteria are also met for persistent depressive disorder, both conditions can be diagnosed.</p>

					<h3>Avoidant Personality Disorder<br>F60.6</h3>
					<p>A pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:</p>
					<ul class="number">
						<li>Avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection.</li>
						<li>Is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked.</li>
						<li>Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed.</li>
						<li>Is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations.</li>
						<li>Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy.</li>
						<li>Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others.</li>
						<li>Is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities because they may prove embarrassing.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Social anxiety disorder.</strong>
						<br>There appears to be a great deal of overlap between avoidant personality disorder and social anxiety disorder. It has been suggested that they may represent different manifestations of similar underlying problems, or avoidant personality disorder may be a more severe form of social anxiety disorder. However, differences have also been described, especially in relation to self-concept (such as self-esteem and the sense of inferiority in avoidant personality disorder); the latter is indirect evidence as it shows that negative self-concept in social anxiety disorder may be unstable and thus less pervasive and entrenched than in avoidant personality disorder. Additionally, studies have shown that avoidant personality disorder frequently occurs in the absence of social anxiety disorder, and some separate risk factors have been identified, providing support for retaining two separate diagnostic categories.</p>

					<p><strong>Agoraphobia.</strong>
						<br>Avoidance characterizes both avoidant personality disorder and agoraphobia, and they often co-occur. They can be distinguished by the motivation for the avoidance (e.g., fear of panic or physical harm in agoraphobia).</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders and personality traits.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with avoidant personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to avoidant personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Both avoidant personality disorder and dependent personality disorder are characterized by feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and a need for reassurance. Similar behaviors (e.g., unassertiveness) and attributes (e.g., low self-esteem and low self-confidence) may be observed in both dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder, although other behaviors are notably divergent, such as avoidance of social proximity in avoidant personality disorder but proximity-seeking in dependent personality disorder. The motivations behind similar behaviors may be quite different. For example, the unassertiveness in avoidant personality disorder is described as more closely related to fears of being rejected or humiliated, whereas in dependent personality disorder it is motivated by the desire to avoid being left to fend for oneself. However, avoidant personality disorder and dependent personality disorder may be particularly likely to co-occur. Like avoidant personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder are characterized by social isolation. However, individuals with avoidant personality disorder want to have relationships with others and feel their loneliness deeply, whereas those with schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder may be content with and even prefer their social isolation. Paranoid personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder are both characterized by a reluctance to confide in others. However, in avoidant personality disorder, this reluctance is attributable more to a fear of humiliation or being found inadequate than to a fear of others’ malicious intent.<br>Many individuals display avoidant personality traits. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute avoidant personality disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality change due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Avoidant personality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge are a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Avoidant personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="Ch18_10" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Dependent Personality Disorder<br>F60.7</h3>
					<p>A pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:</p>
					<ul class="number">
						<li>Has difficulty making everyday decisions without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others.</li>
						<li>Needs others to assume responsibility for most major areas of his or her life.</li>
						<li>Has difficulty expressing disagreement with others because of fear of loss of support or approval. (<strong>Note:</strong> Do not include realistic fears of retribution.)</li>
						<li>Has difficulty initiating projects or doing things on his or her own (because of a lack of self-confidence in judgment or abilities rather than a lack of motivation or energy).</li>
						<li>Goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others, to the point of volunteering to do things that are unpleasant.</li>
						<li>Feels uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated fears of being unable to care for himself or herself.</li>
						<li>Urgently seeks another relationship as a source of care and support when a close relationship ends.</li>
						<li>Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of himself or herself.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Separation anxiety disorder in adults.</strong>
						<br>Adults with separation anxiety disorder are typically overconcerned about their offspring, spouses, parents, and pets, and experience marked discomfort when separated from them. In contrast, individuals with dependent personality disorder feel uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated fears of being unable to take care of themselves.</p>

					<p><strong>Other mental disorders and medical conditions.</strong>
						<br>Dependent personality disorder must be distinguished from dependency arising as a consequence of other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders, panic disorder, agoraphobia) and as a result of other medical conditions.</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders and personality traits.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with dependent personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to dependent personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although many personality disorders are characterized by dependent features, dependent personality disorder can be distinguished by its predominantly submissive and clinging behavior and by the person’s self-perception of not being able to function adequately without the help and support of others. Both dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder are characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual with borderline personality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of emotional emptiness, rage, and demands, whereas the individual with dependent personality disorder reacts with increasing appeasement and submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide caregiving and support. Borderline personality disorder can further be distinguished from dependent personality disorder by a typical pattern of unstable and intense relationships. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder, like those with dependent personality disorder, have a strong need for reassurance and approval and may appear childlike and clinging. However, unlike dependent personality disorder, which is characterized by self-effacing and docile behavior, histrionic personality disorder is characterized by gregarious flamboyance with active demands for attention. Moreover, individuals with histrionic personality disorder typically have less insight regarding their underlying dependency needs than do people with dependent personality disorder. Both dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder are characterized by feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and a need for reassurance; however, individuals with avoidant personality disorder have such a strong fear of humiliation and rejection that they withdraw until they are certain they will be accepted. In contrast, individuals with dependent personality disorder have a pattern of seeking and maintaining connections to important others, rather than avoiding and withdrawing from relationships.<br>Many individuals display dependent personality traits. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute dependent personality disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality change due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Dependent personality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge are a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Dependent personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="Ch18_11" class="AllDiags">
					<h3>Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder<br>F60.5</h3>
					<p>A pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:</p>
					<ul class="number">
						<li>Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost.</li>
						<li>Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met).</li>
						<li>Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity).</li>
						<li>Is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification).</li>
						<li>Is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value.</li>
						<li>Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things.</li>
						<li>Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes.</li>
						<li>Shows rigidity and stubbornness.</li>
					</ul>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</strong>
						<br>Despite the similarity in names, OCD is usually easily distinguished from obsessive-compulsive personality disorder by the presence of true obsessions and compulsions in OCD. When criteria for both obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and OCD are met, both diagnoses should be recorded.</p>

					<p><strong>Hoarding disorder.</strong>
						<br>A diagnosis of hoarding disorder should be considered especially when hoarding is extreme (e.g., accumulated stacks of worthless objects present a fire hazard and make it difficult for others to walk through the house). When criteria for both obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and hoarding disorder are met, both diagnoses should be recorded.</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders and personality traits.</strong>
						<br>Other personality disorders may be confused with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to obsessive- compulsive personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may also profess a commitment to perfectionism and believe that others cannot do things as well, but these individuals are more likely to believe that they have achieved perfection, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are usually self-critical. Individuals with narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder lack generosity but will indulge themselves, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder adopt a miserly spending style toward both self and others. Both schizoid personality disorder and obsessive- compulsive personality disorder may be characterized by an apparent formality and social detachment. In obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, this stems from discomfort with emotions and excessive devotion to work, whereas in schizoid personality disorder there is a fundamental lack of capacity for intimacy.<br>Obsessive-compulsive personality traits in moderation may be especially adaptive, particularly in situations that reward high performance. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Personality change due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits are a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>

					<h3>Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition<br>F07.0</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>A persistent personality disturbance that represents a change from the individual’s previous characteristic personality pattern.<br><strong>Note:</strong> In children, the disturbance involves a marked deviation from normal development or a significant change in the child’s usual behavior patterns, lasting at least 1 year.</li>
						<li>There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.</li>
						<li>The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (including another mental disorder due to another medical condition).</li>

							<li><strong>Aggressive type:</strong> If the predominant feature is aggressive behavior.</li> Apathetic type: If the predominant feature is marked apathy and indifference.
							<li><strong>Paranoid type:</strong> If the predominant feature is suspiciousness or paranoid</li> ideation.

					<p><strong>Coding note:</strong> Include the name of the other medical condition (e.g., F07.0 personality change due to temporal lobe epilepsy).

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Chronic medical conditions associated with pain and disability.</strong>
						<br>Chronic medical conditions associated with pain and disability can also be associated with changes in personality. The diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is given only if a direct pathophysiological mechanism can be established. This diagnosis is not given if the change is due to a behavioral or psychological adjustment or response to another medical condition (e.g., dependent behaviors that result from a need for the assistance of others following a severe head trauma, cardiovascular disease, or dementia).</p>

					<p><strong>Delirium or major neurocognitive disorder.</strong>
						<br>Personality change is a frequently associated feature of a delirium or major neurocognitive disorder. A separate diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is not given if the change occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, the diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition may be given in addition to the diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder if the personality change is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder and if the personality change is a prominent part of the clinical presentation.</p>

					<p><strong>Another mental disorder due to another medical condition.</strong>
						<br>The diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is not given if the disturbance is better explained by another mental disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., depressive disorder due to brain tumor).</p>

					<p><strong>Substance use disorders.</strong>
						<br>Personality changes may also occur in the context of substance use disorders, especially if the disorder is long-standing. The clinician should inquire carefully about the nature and extent of substance use. If the clinician wishes to indicate an etiological relationship between the personality change and substance use, the other specified category for the specific substance can be used (e.g., other specified stimulant-related disorder with personality change).</p>

					<p><strong>Other mental disorders.</strong>
						<br>Marked personality changes may also be an associated feature of other mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder; depressive and bipolar disorders; other specified and unspecified disruptive behavior, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; panic disorder). However, in these disorders, no specific physiological factor is judged to be etiologically related to the personality change.</p>

					<p><strong>Other personality disorders.</strong>
						<br>Personality change due to another medical condition can be distinguished from a personality disorder by the requirement for a clinically significant change from baseline personality functioning and the presence of a specific etiological medical condition.</p>

The majority of individuals who are active in community networks that practice sadistic and masochistic behaviors do not express any dissatisfaction with their sexual interests, and their behavior would not meet DSM-5 criteria for sexual sadism disorder.</p>
					<p><strong>Infliction of physical or psychological suffering during the commission of a sex crime.</strong>
						<br>Individuals who commit rape or other sexual assaults might inflict pain on their victims as a result of the act of rape, or in the course of subduing victims or restraining them to commit the sexual assault. Such instrumental infliction of pain should not be considered to be indicative of sexual sadism disorder unless there is evidence that the individual is deriving pleasure from the infliction of pain and the resulting suffering of the victim (e.g., admission of specifically being aroused by the pain, evidence of a preference for pornography involving themes of sexual sadism, excessive use of pain-inducing violence that goes beyond what might be necessary in the course of committing the sexual assault).</p>
					<p><strong>Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder may be physically cruel to people and force others to engage in sexual activity. Coercive or sadistic sexual behaviors that occur in the context of conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder but that do not reflect an underlying pattern of sexual arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person should not be used as a basis for diagnosing sexual sadism disorder. In cases in which the diagnostic criteria are met for both sexual sadism disorder and conduct disorder/antisocial personality disorder, both disorders may be diagnosed.</p>

					<h3>Pedophilic Disorder<br>F65.4</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger).</li>
						<li>The individual has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.</li>
						<li>The individual is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A.<br><strong>Note:</strong> Do not include an individual in late adolescence involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old.</li>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Pedophilia.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with pedophilia experience recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies or sexual urges involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children. Unless the individual has acted on these sexual urges with a prepubescent child or unless the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty, a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder is not warranted.</p>

					<p><strong>Other paraphilic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Sometimes individuals present with a different paraphilic disorder but are referred for an evaluation regarding possible pedophilic disorder (e.g., when an individual with a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder exposes himself to children as well as adults). In some cases, both diagnoses may apply, whereas in others, it may be the case that one paraphilic disorder diagnosis is sufficient. For example, an individual who exposes himself exclusively to prepubescent children may have both exhibitionistic disorder and pedophilic disorder, whereas another individual who exposes himself to victims, irrespective of the victims’ age, may be considered to have only exhibitionistic disorder.</p>

					<p><strong>Antisocial personality disorder.</strong>
						<br>Some individuals with antisocial personality disorder sexually abuse children, reflecting the fact that the presence of antisocial personality disorder increases the likelihood that an individual who is primarily attracted to mature persons will approach a child sexually, on the basis of relative access to the child. An additional diagnosis of pedophilic disorder should only be considered if there is evidence that over a period of at least 6 months, the individual has also had recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child.</p>

					<p><strong>Substance intoxication.</strong>
						<br>The disinhibiting effects of substance intoxication may also increase the likelihood that an individual who is primarily attracted to mature persons will sexually approach a child.</p>

					<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</strong>
						<br>There are occasional individuals who complain about ego- dystonic thoughts and worries about possible attraction to children. Clinical interviewing usually reveals an absence of positive feelings about these thoughts, no connection between these thoughts and sexual behavior (e.g., masturbating to these thoughts), and sometimes additional ego-dystonic, intrusive sexual ideas (e.g., concerns about homosexuality).</p>

					<h3>Fetishistic Disorder<br>F65.0</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either the use of nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on nongenital body part(s), as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.</li>
						<li>The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
						<li>The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used in cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder) or devices specifically designed for the purpose of tactile genital stimulation (e.g., vibrator).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>Body part(s)</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Nonliving object(s)</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Other</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p>Specify if:
						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>In a controlled environment:</strong> This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in fetishistic behaviors are restricted.</li>
							<li><strong>In full remission:</strong> There has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Transvestic disorder.</strong>
						<br>The nearest diagnostic neighbor of fetishistic disorder is transvestic disorder. As noted in the diagnostic criteria, fetishistic disorder is not diagnosed when fetish objects are limited to articles of clothing exclusively worn during cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder), or when the object is genitally stimulating because it has been designed for that purpose (e.g., a vibrator).</p>

					<p><strong>Sexual masochism disorder or other paraphilic disorders.</strong>
						<br>Fetishistic disorder can co-occur with other paraphilic disorders, especially sadomasochistic behavior or interests and transvestic disorder. When an individual fantasizes about or engages in “forced cross-dressing” and is primarily sexually aroused by the domination or humiliation associated with such fantasy or repetitive activity, and experiences distress or functional impairment, the diagnosis of sexual masochism disorder should be made.</p>

					<p><strong>Fetishism.</strong>
						<br>Use of a fetish object for sexual arousal (fetishism) without any associated distress or psychosocial role impairment or other adverse consequence would not meet criteria for fetishistic disorder, as the threshold required by Criterion B would not be met. For example, an individual whose sexual partner either shares or can successfully incorporate his interest in caressing, smelling, or licking feet or toes as an important element of foreplay would not be diagnosed with fetishistic disorder; nor would an individual who prefers, and is not distressed or impaired by, solitary sexual behavior associated with wearing rubber garments or leather boots.</p>

					<h3>Transvestic Disorder<br>F65.1</h3>
					<ul class="upperAlhpa">
						<li>Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.</li>
						<li>The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>

						<ul class="specifier">
							<li><strong>In a controlled environment:</strong> This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to cross-dress are restricted.</li>

					<br><br><br>
					<p><strong>【Differential Diagnosis】</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Transvestism.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with transvestism experience recurrent and intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing. Unless the fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving cross-dressing are accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, a diagnosis of transvestic disorder is not warranted.</p>

					<p><strong>Fetishistic disorder.</strong>
						<br>This disorder may resemble transvestic disorder, in particular, in men with fetishism who put on women’s undergarments while masturbating with them. Distinguishing transvestic disorder depends on the individual’s specific thoughts during such activity (e.g., are there any ideas of being a woman, being like a woman, or being dressed as a woman?) and on the presence of other fetishes (e.g., soft, silky fabrics, whether these are used for garments or for something else).</p>

					<p><strong>Gender dysphoria.</strong>
						<br>Individuals with transvestic disorder do not report an incongruence between their experienced gender and their assigned gender or a desire to be of the other gender; and they typically do not have a history of childhood cross-gender behaviors, which would be present in individuals with gender dysphoria. Individuals with a presentation that meets full criteria for transvestic disorder as well as gender dysphoria should be given both diagnoses.</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder<br>F65.89</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a paraphilic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The other specified paraphilic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific paraphilic disorder. This is done by recording “other specified paraphilic disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “zoophilia”).</p>

					<h3>Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition<br>F06.8</h3>
					<p>This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable to another medical condition. The other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable to another medical condition. This is done by recording the name of the disorder, with the specific etiological medical condition inserted in place of “another medical condition,” followed by the specific symptomatic manifestation that does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder due to another medical condition. Furthermore, the diagnostic code for the specific medical condition must be listed immediately before the code for the other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition. For example, dissociative symptoms due to complex partial seizures would be coded and recorded as G40.209 complex partial seizures, F06.8 other specified mental disorder due to complex partial seizures, dissociative symptoms.</p>
					<p>An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” designation is the following:
